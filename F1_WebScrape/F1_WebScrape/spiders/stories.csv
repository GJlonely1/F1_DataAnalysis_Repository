"Alpine have revealed a striking one-off livery ahead of the Belgian Grand Prix weekend, inspired by the upcoming Deadpool & Wolverine film.Instead of their usual design, Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon will be driving cars adorned in red and black, complete with yellow claw marks, in a nod to the two Marvel superheroes depicted in the new movie.Deadpool actor Ryan Reynolds was part of a group of investors who were behind a €200m cash injection in Alpine last year, to further the team's ambitions in Formula 1.READ MORE: ‘We don’t give ourselves chances’ – Frustrated Gasly admits Alpine suffering ‘too many issues’ after Hungary DNFThe Enstone-based squad will be hoping their new look can help them bounce back from another tough weekend last time out in Hungary. Gasly and Ocon qualified on the back row after a strategic error from the team resulted in them not putting a final lap in during Q1.Gasly then started the race from the pit lane due to set-up and power unit element changes being made to his car, but he was subsequently forced to retire from the race due to a suspected hydraulics issue. Ocon, meanwhile would come home in a lowly 18th place.View the special livery in the gallery above."

They’ve had the most complete car since introducing their Miami upgrade package, and Hungary showed they have two drivers capable of scoring wins.The fight for the constructors' title is well and truly on as a result, but as we saw in Hungary, having two drivers capable of fighting each other can also lead to stress."

"One race to go before the August break, and Oscar Piastri’s victory in Hungary continued the competitive nature of the season as he became the seventh different winner in 13 races. Who will come out on top at Spa-Francorchamps is just one of many intriguing aspects heading to Belgium...That’s right, we’re back into the realms of talking about a championship fight, even with big margins in the drivers’ standings.Part of the uncertainty between Lando Norris and his team about whether Norris was going to return a position to Oscar Piastri in Hungary was due to the British driver admitting he still feels like he has a chance of beating Max Verstappen to the drivers’ championship this year. And the stats actually back him up.READ MORE: 5 Winners and 5 Losers from the Hungarian Grand Prix – Who drove brilliantly in Budapest?Norris is currently 76 points behind Verstappen – over three full race victories – but more than half of that advantage (39 points) was built up across the first two races. Verstappen won in both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia when McLaren’s launch-spec car was not overly competitive, but since a major upgrade was introduced in Miami the points difference between the two has been just 26 points in total."
