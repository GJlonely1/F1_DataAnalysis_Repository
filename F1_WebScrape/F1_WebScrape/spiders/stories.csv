"There was a statistic doing the rounds in the paddock at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, back at the start of June. The Canadian Grand Prix would be our last standalone race until May 2025. For the next year, until Formula 1 next rocks up at the Miami International Autodrome, it’s doubles and triples all the way. That's a tantalising prospect for fans and one of the leading questions asked by F1 fans at this time of year – how do teams cope with these back-to-back races?Fans doing a pit-lane walk are often impressed – sometimes puzzled – when they see the pristine garage operating at one circuit, when they know a few days ago it was 1600km away at another circuit. It doesn’t pack down in an hour, it isn’t air-freighted and it isn’t magic – but it also isn’t the same garage."

"Red Bull’s Max Verstappen ended Saturday’s third and final practice session at the top of the timesheets, with running limited by persistent rain and a crash for Aston Martin driver Lance Stroll that brought out the red flags.After a largely dry first day at Spa-Francorchamps, showers overnight and through the morning made for a sodden track surface when FP3 began at 1230 local time – meaning drivers bolted on intermediate and wet tyres for their initial runs.PRACTICE DEBRIEF: Are McLaren favourites to repeat their one-two, or can Verstappen bounce back from his penalty in Spa?With a “big chunk” of rain forecast five to 10 minutes into the session, as per Daniel Ricciardo’s race engineer, plenty of cars hit the track early on to get some laps under their belts, bringing a range of lap times between the 2m and 2m 30s mark.Then, as predicted, the heavens opened and topped up the puddles all over the track – TV replays highlighting the challenge when both Lando Norris and Yuki Tsunoda were caught running wide and taking trips through the gravel at the Les Combes section."
