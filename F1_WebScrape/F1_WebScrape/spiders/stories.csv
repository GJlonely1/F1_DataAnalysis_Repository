I mean I definitely did not expect that this weekend.“Obviously with the tricky conditions we could do something above our expectations – it’s a good day for the team. Now we need to focus on tomorrow and see what will happen whenever the rain is gone.”He continued: “I think without this rain probably P5 was the position we were fighting for with the Mercedes especially. Obviously with the rain it helped us a little bit, but I’m not going to complain."

"Qualifying day brought mixed feelings for McLaren in Belgium, with Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri claiming P5 and P6 – which will become P4 and P5 after Max Verstappen’s 10-place grid drop – despite showing strong pace on Friday.With the session taking place on a damp track after heavy rainfall earlier on at Spa-Francorchamps, the drivers were faced with tricky conditions as the session played out. Given that, Norris was left satisfied with his end result, having also felt that he had not been driving at his best.READ MORE: Verstappen claims P1 in Belgium qualifying ahead of grid penalty with Leclerc to start race from pole“[It was] tough, but I’m honestly pretty happy with today,” the Briton said after the session. “I think, in the end, me and Oscar were split by half a tenth or something.“Clearly we were lacking comparing to the cars ahead – especially the Red Bull, the Red Bull’s another level comparing to us in the rain and even in the dry they were probably still a bit stronger.“A tough day, I expected worse and I’ve not been driving particularly well, just one of those days where it’s not clicking. Kind of similar to yesterday honestly, so just a little bit of a struggle for me, so to start with P5 I was pretty happy with.”"
