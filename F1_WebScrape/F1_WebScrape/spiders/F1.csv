"Toto Wolff says Mercedes are hoping for a return to cooler temperatures next weekend in Belgium after Mercedes’ two-race winning streak came to an end in the heat of Hungary.With the warm conditions not favouring the W15 as much as cooler climes, the Silver Arrows were not quite able to match the pace they displayed during their victorious weekends in Austria and at Silverstone.READ MORE: Hamilton thrilled with podium in Hungary after ‘very tough’ race as he reflects on ‘hair-raising’ battle with VerstappenHowever, Hamilton got the most out of his afternoon at the Hungaroring, a track that he has won at a record eight times. Despite struggling to make his tyres last during the final stint – as well as facing a feisty scrap with Max Verstappen for P3 along the way – the Briton held on to take the third spot on the podium behind winner Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris.Hamilton's team mate George Russell, meanwhile, started from down in P17 after errors from himself and Mercedes during qualifying, leaving him with work to do on race day. The 26-year-old had a long first stint before being undercut by the Red Bull of Sergio Perez during the second stops, giving him a final position of eighth.",,
"Max Verstappen was outspoken throughout the Hungarian Grand Prix in Budapest, voicing his opinions on the team’s chosen strategy, his car's performance and his rivals' driving.It led to some eyebrow raising radio exchanges between the Dutchman and his Race Engineer Gianpiero Lambiase – but Team Principal Christian Horner was swift to dispel any rumours of a rift when he spoke to the media after the Grand Prix.Verstappen's frustrations began at the very first corner of the opening lap when he felt he was pushed wide by Lando Norris. But running second, the team asked him to give the place back to the McLaren man or risk face a penalty.He was then undercut twice by Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes on a day where the undercut was powerful and track position was king, before late contact between the pair dropped the Dutchman from fourth to fifth at the flag.READ MORE: Piastri admits McLaren team orders made him ‘a bit nervous’ as he reflects on ‘very special’ maiden win in HungaryBut speaking after the race Horner insisted he had no concerns about his driver's approach to the race, or to team communications.",,

"NEWS Pierre Gasly has called on Alpine to “stop allowing missed opportunities” after recording his second non-finish in a row, having been forced to retire from the Hungarian Grand Prix owing to a suspected hydraulics issue. It was a tough weekend for the Enstone-based squad, with Gasly and team mate Esteban Ocon qualifying on the back row after a strategic error from the team resulted in them not putting a final lap in during Q1. Gasly then started the race from the pit lane due to set-up and power unit element changes being made to his A524 ahead of the Grand Prix. READ MORE: Piastri wins Hungarian Grand Prix as Norris belatedly hands back lead in McLaren intra-team drama While the Frenchman did make some ground come Sunday afternoon, his race was over before the halfway point, and the 28-year-old voiced his disappointment about missing out on the battle for points when speaking to the media afterwards. “It’s too many issues, too many problems,” said Gasly. “It’s a massive shame because we started from the pit lane, we [were] actually in front of Fernando [Alonso] at that stage of the race, our strategy worked perfectly with what others decided to do. “I think we put ourselves in contention for one or two points, and… today it’s hydraulics, yesterday was the strategy, last week I didn’t race at Silverstone because of the gearbox.     ‘It’s a massive shame’ – Gasly downbeat after DNF in Budapest “There’s just too many issues and I know the team is much better than that, so we just collectively need to do a lot better and stop allowing missed opportunities weekend after weekend.” Pushed on whether – given Alpine’s challenging start to the season – the problems may have arisen from trying to play catch-up too quickly, Gasly responded: “No, these are two different topics. Hydraulics and gearbox and this is reliability, yesterday strategy. HIGHLIGHTS: Enjoy the action from a controversial Hungarian GP as Piastri claims maiden F1 victory “I know we should not be doing this type of mistake and I trust the team, I know that they’re good enough not to do this, so we’ve just got to be more focused, we’ve got to be more on it. “As I said, it’s frustrating considering we had the performance to – even from the pit lane – make it to the top-10 and fight for these points. We are having a tough season, we need to capitalise on any opportunities and we just don’t give ourselves these chances.” The day did not prove much more successful for Ocon who, despite making it to the end of the race, crossed the line second to last in 18th place.     Ocon deflated after 'disappointing weekend' in Hungary Quizzed on how the car had felt on Sunday after the frustrations of Saturday’s running, the 27-year-old answered: “Worse. Disappointing weekend from an operational side point of view, disappointing weekend from a performance car point of view, disappointing weekend from a reliability side of things – I guess that’s why Pierre DNF’d. “We should have just saved the car at the end of the race, there was nothing for us to play for. We were not quick, we took not the ideal strategy. Nothing was good to keep so we need a good reset before Spa.” FACTS AND STATS: Hamilton hits 200 podiums as Piastri becomes first winner born this century In terms of whether he and the team have any ideas as to why the performance was not there during the Hungarian Grand Prix, Ocon spoke of the difficulties in solving the problems as he explained: “Yes, plenty of ideas. “First of all we were not very competitive in general, but there are other issues with my car that [I’ve been] having for quite a few events that we need to get rid of, but we can’t find it, so that’s where it is tricky.” © 2003-2024 Formula One World Championship Limited",,

"NEWS     McLaren boss Andrea Stella says that far from being upset with Lando Norris’ initial refusal to follow instructions from the pit wall and let his team mate past for victory on Sunday, he would have been “very concerned” had the Brit simply waved Oscar Piastri through without a word of complaint. Pole-sitter Norris dropped behind team mate Oscar Piastri when Sunday’s encounter at the Hungaroring got under way, with the Australian managing to build a comfortable advantage and maintain the lead through the opening round of pit stops. READ MORE > MONDAY MORNING DEBRIEF: Why did McLaren pit Norris before Piastri – and did they really need to? However, with McLaren later feeling threatened by the power of the undercut from cars behind, they elected to bring Norris in for fresh tyres before Piastri during the second sequence of stops – leading to the two cars swapping positions given the pace offset. Piastri was told by his race engineer not to worry about the development, with Norris being asked to move aside and relinquish P1 given that he had gained it in the pit lane, only for the Briton to initially question the call and show some reluctance. Eventually, via several pleas from engineer Will Joseph that included being reminded about McLaren’s pre-race meetings, Norris backed off and allowed Piastri through, but it was a moment that sparked plenty of debate amongst onlookers. Stella congratulates race winner Oscar Piastri In an interview with Sky Sports F1 shortly after the chequered flag, McLaren team boss Stella was asked for more details on what is discussed in those Sunday meetings and whether he was concerned Norris might not give up the place. “I think there was a little bit more than that single comment and message from Will,” replied Stella. “There’s an entire approach to racing that we have with our drivers – team and drivers. READ MORE: ‘I know what Oscar’s done for me’ – Norris gives his take on ‘tough’ moment he let Piastri past in Hungary “We are in this trajectory together. None of us, the team, Lando, Oscar, can go alone. That’s the message. That’s the message that we discussed on Sunday morning. With race drivers, you need to refresh this message, that’s why we have this meeting every Sunday. “We are extremely pleased by how our drivers are supporting the trajectory of McLaren, which is incredible. For me, that’s the news today. “The message is that there’s a P1 and P2 in qualifying, P1 and P2 in the race. I would like to thank and praise all the work of the men and women at McLaren to make this possible.”     Norris: ‘I put myself in Oscar’s shoes and realised I had to do what was right’ Stella went on to discuss Norris’s determination to challenge Red Bull rival Max Verstappen for the championship and how McLaren will manage the situation between their drivers moving forward. Norris remains second in the drivers’ standings, 76 points behind reigning world champion Verstappen, with team mate Piastri a further 40 points adrift in fifth position. READ MORE: Piastri admits McLaren team orders made him ‘a bit nervous’ as he reflects on ‘very special’ maiden win in Hungary “I think I don’t know any race driver that when he is leading a race would be happy to say, ‘Oh yeah, of course, why don’t we swap back the position to the previous order?’ That’s not possible, that’s not the nature of the drivers,” Stella commented. “I would be extremely worried, you would see here me very concerned, if Lando would say so. I think that’s why we needed to recall our principles, that’s why we recalled the principles on Sunday morning. “I think it’s true that for a driver, if we want to be competitive in the championship, for Lando in particular [who] is in the stronger position, he will need the support of Oscar, he will need the support of the team. I think that’s how we are moving forward.” © 2003-2024 Formula One World Championship Limited",,
"NEWS Charles Leclerc was ""relatively happy"" after taking P4 in the Hungarian Grand Prix – his best result since winning in Monaco back in May – but was left concerned Ferrari are slipping further back from the current pace setters. Having lined up in sixth on the grid, Leclerc at one stage found himself closing in on Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen’s battle for third. While Hamilton remained ahead – and Verstappen slipped down to fifth following contact between the two world champions – Leclerc crossed the line in fourth. READ MORE: Piastri wins Hungarian Grand Prix as Norris belatedly hands back lead in McLaren intra-team drama “I’m relatively happy,” the Ferrari driver said after the race. “I mean, I’m never happy with a P4 but if you do a step back, considering the tough few races I’ve had in the last few weekends… We came here saying we need to maximise the team points, we need to maximise the car, and I think we did that today, so on that I’m happy. “On the other hand, I’m not happy because the performance is not where we want it to be. McLaren is quite a far bit ahead now, Red Bull was a bit closer than what we thought today. But I think we had a pretty good race pace, we were just a bit stuck because it’s a track where you cannot really overtake.”     Leclerc left ’relatively happy’ with P4 finish in Hungary Asked about the current mindset within the team – and whether there are fixes on the way, or if they were expecting some time to pass before they can catch Red Bull and McLaren – Leclerc looked ahead to the next race on the calendar in Belgium as he explained: “I think Spa will be a real test for the issues we’ve had in the last few races. “It feels like a small step forward here. However, it’s not a track that put in evidence the weaknesses of our car, so let’s wait for Spa and see how much of a step forward we’ve done.” HIGHLIGHTS: Enjoy the action from a controversial Hungarian GP as Piastri claims maiden F1 victory Ferrari team mate Carlos Sainz, meanwhile, slipped backwards in the order at the Hungaroring, with a poor start dropping him from his grid position of fourth down to a final result of sixth. Quizzed on whether his launch had ultimately set the tone for the rest of his race, Sainz answered: “Yeah, exactly. Unfortunately [it was my] first bad start of the season and at a place that is very costly.     Sainz reckons bad start cost him chance of P3 in Hungary “We need to analyse whether it was my mistake on the procedure, or we just simply got it wrong with the clutch settings and we triggered too much wheelspin for the grip that there was out there today. We’ll do a good analysis, one bad start per season is okay – it’s unfortunate that it happened here in Hungary.” Given Verstappen’s issues later on in the Grand Prix, Sainz believes that he could potentially have been in contention for a podium had he not gone backwards off the line. FACTS AND STATS: Hamilton hits 200 podiums as Piastri becomes first winner born this century “You’re pretty much fixed on your position after there [from the start],” the Spaniard said. “That’s why we would have made it P4 after Turn 1, I think P4 was on the cards today or P3 even with Max’s troubled race. “So a shame because I felt good in the car all weekend, it is true that today it was a bit trickier with the balance and in high fuel, but the pace on the last stint was a bit better and I could catch everyone back up, but it was a bit too late.” © 2003-2024 Formula One World Championship Limited",,

Such is the high tyre degradation this track imposes, the earlier stop undercut Norris – who had been less than 2s behind – ahead. His new medium tyres were so much faster than the 27-lap old hard tyres on Piastri’s car.

"NEWS 1. Oscar Piastri (McLaren), 2. Lando Norris (McLaren), 3. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) TRACK INTERVIEWS
(Conducted by Nico Rosberg) Q: Wow, this is really Formula 1 at its best at the moment! It's unbelievably exciting out there to watch from outside. Lewis, P3 today. You beat the Red Bulls fair and square as well. Good feeling? Lewis HAMILTON: Yeah. Big thanks to this amazing crowd this weekend. And a huge congratulations to McLaren on the 1-2. That's my old, original family, so I'm really, really happy to see you, all the boys, the whole team, back up front. And then for us today, yeah, the team has done a great job to continue on with pushing this car. Ultimately, we didn't have the pace of the McLarens, nor did we have the pace of the Red Bulls, but we just were able to hold on at the beginning of the race. It was very, very tough to hold on, to make those tyres last. And obviously, the close battle we had at the end was a bit hair-raising, but that's motor racing. So I'm really happy. I'm grateful for the points. Big thank you to the team. Q: Take us through that battle a little bit, with Max. I mean, it was just unbelievable to watch from the outside. How nerve-wracking was it from inside the car? LH: It's not nerve-wracking. I think when you see the pace at which they close the gap in certain corners, you just laugh to yourself, because it's not something I can do. Particularly in the last sector, they were very, very strong, same as the McLarens. So, I mean, I saw him coming from a long way back, and he was able to brake a lot later than me. But he sent it up the inside. I stayed still, and he clipped the wheel and went over. So I think a racing incident, but, you know, yeah. Q: Let's have a word for Oscar, who just had his first win on a Sunday in his career. You have more than 100, many more, so let's have a word for Oscar. LH: Yeah, amazing. Congratulations to Oscar. He's been doing a fantastic job ever since he got here, to be honest, but he's been so consistent, and it was only a matter of time before he got a win, so this is a great day for him. He had an amazing pace from the get-go, so really, really happy for him and his family. Q: Thank you very much, Lewis. Let's hope for more progress from you guys in the next couple of races. Lando, let's start with a fantastic team effort this weekend. I mean the car has been phenomenal, one-two that's a super result of the team isn't it? LN: Yeah, an amazing day for us as a team. I think that's the main thing, honestly. I'm so happy. It's been a long journey to get to achieving this on merit and that's exactly what we did today, and I think a long way clear of the rest, so we did it in style as well. So a good run by the team, and of course to Oscar. He had a good start, he got me off the line, and he controlled the race well. So yeah, it was coming at some point, and he deserved it today. Q: Sorry, but I have to obviously ask: we were thinking, is he maybe not going to let him through, or what's going to happen there? We got the impression you thought it was not quite fair for the team to ask you to let him back through. Can you take us through your thinking there? LN: The team asked me to do it, so I did it, and yeah, that's it. Q: OK, I'm not going to dig further on that one then. How excited are you for the rest of the season? I mean, it really seems that you guys have the fastest car out there at the moment. You still believe in the championship as well then? LN: For sure. I mean, definitely as a constructor, two good drivers and an amazing team. So absolutely, I think it’s still difficult, still a long way to go. And today was our day. Spa, it can change completely, you know. So we'll keep pushing and we'll try to do more of the same. Q: OK, thank you very much, Lando. Congrats on the second place in team effort. Oscar, it is your first Formula 1 win on a Sunday. How awesome is that feeling? It's your first win. How special is it? Oscar PIASTRI: Very, very special. This is really the day I dreamed of as a kid, standing on the top step of an F1 podium. Yeah, obviously a bit complicated at the end, but I put myself in the right position at the start. And yeah, thank you to the team for an amazing effort, an amazing car. Yeah, it's a hell of a lot of fun racing with McLaren, so I can't thank them enough for giving me the opportunity to be in F1. And yeah, to now be winning together 18 months in is an incredible feeling. Q: And how impressed are you with the car that McLaren's giving you at the moment? I mean, it just looks phenomenal out there. OP: Yeah, it's a beast at the moment. Yeah, it's fast in every condition. I think today, you know, we had it under control completely. And yeah, an amazing feeling to just be able to manage the race like that with both cars and secure a one-two. I don't know when our last one-two was, but I think it's a long time ago. So incredibly happy for the whole team and nice to get my first one on the board. Q: You said it's all under control, but the team order situation didn't seem very much under control from the outside. How worried were you towards the end there that Lando might actually not let you pass? OP: The longer you leave it, of course, the more you get a bit nervous. But, no, it was well executed by the team. Yeah, I think it was the right thing. I put myself in the right position at the start. And yeah, with the different strategy we had, yes, my pace probably wasn't as quick as I would have liked in the last stint, but I was still in the right position to make it happen. So yeah, well executed from the team. Q: So I suppose then the first of many wins, right, Oscar? I mean, you're proving to be such a special talent out there. OP: I hope so. Yeah, I mean, I think I've still got some things to work on, but, no, I'll enjoy the win when I can. And, yeah, the team's given me a great car, and I really can't thank them enough for that. And, yeah, I'm trying to do the best job I can, and I'm learning every race I do. So, yeah, I hope there's many more to come. Q: Next up is Spa. Very different track, very different downforce level in the car. Do you expect yourselves to be right at the front there as well? OP: I think yes. I think we've proven this year that we can be quick in any circuit, any condition. We're always there at the front. And I mean, Spa's not been the happiest of hunting grounds for us recently, but I'm confident we'll be strong. You know, we've got a car that's become a real all-rounder, so I'm super confident, and I think the rest of the team should be as well. PRESS CONFERENCE Q: Lando, many congratulations. It's been a very impressive weekend by you and McLaren. First of all, how do you sum up the last two days? LN: I'm trying to think of a cool word. I don't know. Just great. Like, it's been amazing. I don't know. A very good weekend, all in all, from all of us as a team. Mistake-free. Great pace in the car. Probably this weekend, I think, we can say confidently I think we were the quickest and I think that's the first time this year I can confidently say that, so amazing. Our first one-two since Monza with Daniel and yeah, an up and down journey. But, you know, since one year ago we were struggling and the turnaround to Miami and from Miami to here. It's been incredible. So as a weekend, fantastic. And I'm very happy for us as a team and everyone that's part of it to reward them with something like this. Q: And how difficult was it for you to give up the race win? LN: I mean, I didn't give up the race win. I lost the race win off the line. so I know everyone is going to want to say that as a story that I gave up the race when I didn't. I boxed first and naturally you’re always going to undercut. So the team gave me this position and I gave it back. Nothing more than that. Q: There was a lot of discussion between you and your race engineer over the radio. How seriously did you consider not giving it back? LN: I mean, things are always going to go through your mind because, you know… You've got to be selfish in this sport at times. You've got to think of yourself. That's priority number one, is think of yourself. I'm also a team player, so my mind was going pretty crazy at the time. I know what we've done in the past between Oscar and myself. He's helped me plenty of times… I think this is a different situation. This is not someone helping one another. I was put into a position, and we were undoing that position change. But I mean, I'm also, and I get it, and I know a lot of people are going to say, like, the gap between me and Max is pretty big, 60, 70, 80 points or something. You know, if Red Bull and Max make the mistakes like they did today and continue to do that, and as a team we continue to improve and have weekends like we've had this weekend, we can turn it around. And it's still optimistic. It's still a big goal to say, yeah, we can close 70 points and as a driver, I can close 70 points in half a season. And then when you're thinking of the seven or six points that I give away, then... It crosses your mind for sure. So it was not easy, but I also understood the situation I was in and I was quite confident always by the last lap I would have done it. Q: Do you think we'll see you be more selfish in the future? LN: It depends. I mean, I've done this for... I don't know. I think I was put in this situation and it's not my fault that I was leading the race in a way. Simply the team should have just boxed Oscar first and we wouldn't even be having this discussion. So, it's not that. I think just as a team, maybe we could have done things slightly differently and I'm sure we'll talk about it. But at the same time... This guy here deserved to win today. He did an amazing job. He got me off the line and yeah, that's a very special feeling winning your first race and I say first race because I think you'll agree that it's his first race win and not a Sprint race. So yeah, I'll let him enjoy it. And you know, for us as a team and to have the win is an incredible weekend for all of us. Q: Alright, Lando, many thanks for that. Let's come on to the race winner now. Oscar, you've dreamt of this moment since you were a boy. You're a Grand Prix winner in just your 35th start. How sweet was the view from the top step of the podium? OP: Yeah, very, very special. A lot of Australian flags, actually, which was very cool to see. Yeah, it was an incredible moment. I mean, it's always special when you get to stand on an F1 podium, but it's a little bit nicer when you're at the top of it, so very happy. Like I said, an incredible moment that I've been dreaming of for a very long time. I said my first dream in my career was reaching F1. The second one is winning a race. Yeah, I'm very, very happy and proud and not just of myself, but everybody that's helped me get to this position. You know, going back to my family, firstly, of course. You know, it took a lot of big decisions at a young age to chase the F1 dream. It's very difficult to become an F1 driver by staying in Australia, so it meant some big decisions early in life. And, yeah, just very, very proud that, you know, those decisions have paid off and we've managed to make it worth it. And, yeah, of course, myself just incredibly happy to have achieved this moment. Q: How different does this feel to the Sprint win in Qatar last year? OP: Very, I would say. I think the Sprint win… It was always a bit awkward, in my opinion. It's a win, but not really a win. This is much more of a proud moment for me than winning the Sprint. Of course, it was a special moment at the time, but now to have no questions, no question marks over whether I'm a race winner or not is a very nice feeling to have. And yeah, the emotion is definitely different. Q: Can we talk about tactics? Given the advantage you and Lando had in that race? Why didn't you stop first? It would have been a lot simpler. OP: I mean, I'm sure it's something we'll discuss as a team. You know, the information I had at the time was Lando was boxing early to cover Lewis, and I was going long to cover Max, essentially, because I knew that he'd stop later, and I think we were just being very safe. Of course, that naturally gave Lando an undercut, maybe made things a little bit more complicated than it needed to be. But yeah, I'm sure that's something we'll go through. Q: Alright. Many congratulations. Thank you. And Lewis, coming to you, 200 podiums, what a score, what a trophy cabinet. Now, you've often said that you're not into statistics, but this surely means something? LH: The number doesn't, no. I just think about these two and how young these guys are. They were in nappies when I started, so… No, honestly, it just makes me think about the whole journey and all the great people I've had the chance to work with. You know, I got signed by McLaren when I was 13 and so there was always so much love for that team and through the journey that we had, where I had my first World Championship and then they went through a really difficult time so to see them back up there is really, really great. I'm really happy. You know that's my old family, so really, really grateful to be up here with them. And then ultimately I think it was a tough race today and I definitely didn't think I would be having 200 podiums but what have I done? Like 340 something races? So, not too bad a score but I couldn't have done it without all those great people that I've worked with in both these teams. 1 / 5 QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR Q: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Lewis, could you talk through the touch with Max? He obviously made that move down the inside. You guys touched. He was on the radio saying about you were moving under braking. Could you talk through your side of it, please? LH: Yeah. No, I think, I mean, from what I can remember, obviously we passed a backmarker. I got to the braking zone, and then Max appeared, to overtake the car behind me, so I moved over to defend. I left enough room in the inside, but Max locked up, and he was going a different trajectory to me. I was going towards, around the corner, and he came shooting across. It felt like a racing incident. And it's easy to make mistakes like that. And so I don't feel there should be any hostility. But of course, from his side, there always will be. Q: (Jannik Sauer – Watson.de) Lewis, I was wondering, because you have this little fan laying next to you, especially after a hot race like today, there were some headlines in the past few days about the FIA planning to implement some sort of cooling for the cockpit and the drivers. So you are surprised, I see. Do we have any opinion on that? LH: Well, firstly, I didn't know that. And it's not needed. This is Formula 1. It's always been like this. It's tough in these conditions. And we're highly-paid athletes. And you've got to train your ass off to make sure you can withstand the heat, ultimately. And it's tough. It's not easy, especially when you go to places like Qatar and Singapore. But I don't think we need an AC unit in the car. Q: (Florian Niedermair – Motorsport-magazin.com) About your race space in general, did you expect before the race to be battling with Max or was it a surprise for you, especially given the conditions? LH: No, I think out of pure pace, we weren't. Unfortunately, we're still not, in hot conditions particularly… So you saw in Austria and here, we're not able to keep up with these guys. But in stint one, I was really surprised to see that I was able to hold on to Max. And I wasn't even having to push too hard to stay within a second, or around a second behind him. So I thought at that point that maybe I was in for a chance of at least fighting for that place. But then in the second stint, it was a bit of a disaster, it didn't feel good. And the true pace of the car started to show, I think, on those tyres. But we obviously got the undercut and track position is clearly key on this track. And I think that really ultimately made the difference. Q: (Edd Straw – The Race) One for Lando, please. As you said, you were always confident you were going to give the place back, but based on the messages we heard, the pit wall seemed quite worried about it. You had a number of reminders, as it were, so why not give them a confirmation just to put their minds at rest that you were going to do it during that phase? LN: I don't need to. I know what I'm going to do and what I'm not going to do. Of course, I'm going to just question it and challenge it, and that's what I did. Yeah. I was going to wait until the last lap, the last corner. But then they said if there was a Safety Car all of a sudden, and I couldn't let Oscar go through, then it would have made me look like a bit of an idiot. Yeah, then I was like, ‘yeah, it’s fair point’. And I let him go, two to go or something. And straight away, I let him go. So yeah, I mean, that's just your opinion of what you hear. But that's the same with all sports. You can make what you will of what you hear and what you think you know and that kind of stuff. But I know that I always was going to give it back unless they changed their mind on what they were saying. And they didn't. So all good. Q: (Phil Duncan – PA) Lando, you said over the radio that you're fighting for the world championship. Do you think that McLaren made the wrong decision today? LN: No. I mean... I didn't lose the win there. I lost the win off the line. You know, I had a terrible, not even a terrible start, just a bad start. Something happened on my second shift and I lost all my momentum. Oscar got to the inside and that was it. That was that. So, you know, I got put into the lead rather than wanting to. I feel like we made things way too hard for ourselves and way too tricky for ourselves. We should have just boxed Oscar first and things would have been simple, but they gave me the lead and I gave it back. So I shouldn't have won today. I didn't deserve to win because of my start and Oscar's good start and that's that. So I don't feel like... I know I was in that position for a while and 16, 17 laps or whatever, It's hard when you're in that position to give it back because you're there. And you're there and of course that went through my mind, seven points that I'm going to lose. But I think the real fact is I shouldn't have almost had them in the first place. I shouldn't have had them in my hands. So the team were right. And I stand by what they said. Q: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Oscar, for you in those stages when you were behind Lando, what was going through your mind? Were you worried that you weren't going to be given the lead back? How much was the concern growing in those final few laps? OP: I don't think I was really concerned. The only thing I was concerned about a bit was if there was a Safety Car, then it would have taken the situation out of our hands, would have taken the control out of our hands. So that was really the only thing I was a bit concerned about. But, you know, we'd spoken about it at the timing of the stop that we would sort it back out. And, yeah, I mean, I had full trust in everyone in the team, including Lando, that we would make that happen. Q: (Peter Farkas – Auto Motor) Lando, at the beginning of the year, everyone thought Max would run away with the championship. And now here we are. McLaren seems to be the quickest car. Do you genuinely think that the championship is now on? And do you feel that you are ready psychologically to take it to the wire with Max? Because we think it could get quite edgy at the end. LN: Yeah, then I look forward to it. I mean, I said at the end of last year that we were going to win races this year. I said at the beginning of the year that it was not going to be an easy one for Red Bull, and all of that's come true. So I think we've done an amazing job as a team. So I think, first of all, we have to give credit to the team for giving us a car in order to do that. We've won today, but this is the second win of the year. Red Bull have had way more wins. Mercedes have almost had as many wins as we've had. Actually, they've had the same amount of wins as we've had. So just because we won one race today and we've had a dominant weekend doesn't mean we're the quickest car. I think maybe two weekends this year, we've had the best car of the grid. That's it. People can come up with their own opinions and say what they like. But, do we have opportunities to maybe win more? Yes. Did we necessarily have the quickest car on those days? I don't think so. But yeah, when I think of that, when I think of what we're doing now, what we are able to do in the future, you know, in the short term and also long term after summer break, and we have more days like today, then of course. You would be silly to say no. But don't get me wrong, I know it's like 70, 80 points that I got to catch up. So I know a lot of people are going to say that there's no chance, but I mean, we're going to keep fighting and I'm going to give myself the best opportunity to do so. You know, especially when you see Max today and Red Bull, not performing so well, making mistakes, crashing. You know, you want to make the most of those opportunities and plenty more can happen in the future. So, yes, I think it's still on. I know it's a big stretch and optimistic, like I said before, but I'm not going to say no to the challenge and definitely as a team, we won't. And psychologically, yeah, I'm happy. I'm ready. I still think, you know, if you throw back to Red Bull Ring, I did nothing wrong in this instance. It wasn't my fault. So I'm ready to go. I'm excited. I'm ready to battle. And I'm looking forward to the battles that we're going to have. Q: (Nate Saunders – ESPN) Lando, a question for you. Just on team orders generally in this situation, Will Joseph mentioned in some of those laps to you, he said, think of those meetings that we have on Sundays, which I assume is just kind of a reference back to discussions about similar situations. If you are going to make a championship fight out of this, at what point do you think McLaren actually need to make calls like that? Because you are right that there's a big gap to you and Max right now, but obviously that gap might come down quicker if McLaren is maybe making those calls quicker. So what do you think needs to, you know, when does that need to happen if you are going to turn this into a championship fight? LN: I think there's just a difference of simply just deserving to win a race and not deserving to win. I didn't deserve to win the race today. Simple as that. So the fact I was in that position was incorrect. I think that was a mistake from us as a team. I shouldn't have been in this position. And it was a strategic way to just play our race. So it gave me hope and it gave me that position of, ‘oh, I'm here now’. But I shouldn't have been there in the first place. I'm not going to talk about it because I shouldn't have been there. I didn't deserve to win. End of story from that side. But yes, it's something we always talk about before every race is our trust in one another, our honesty we have as a group. I think that's something that's allowed us to catch others so quickly to perform and outperform others so quickly to develop the car quicker. As a team, I think we have and have shown plenty of times between drivers, whether it has been Carlos and myself, Daniel and myself, Oscar and myself, that when things do go one another's way, we're there to help one another, you know? And today is a different day. It's not because strategically something's really happened and you're kind of just letting someone pass or something's going that way it’s that I shouldn't have been in that position in the first place. I shouldn't have been given that hope of I'm here, I'm leading a race. So I don't think it's a fair thing. But of course we're going to discuss it and there's going to be times maybe in the future where things are like that. But if Oscar's led the whole race, I don't want him just to... It's not fair, and I don't think that's how it should work, that he should just let me pass for me to win because I'm fighting for a championship. Maybe I'll ask Oscar, maybe he will! Maybe he'd let me pass! But today was his, and that should be it. It wasn't my race today. He drove better, and he got a good start, and that was that, so... Yeah, like I said, something we'll speak about as a team and we speak about all the time. Something we're good at and something we'll continue to do good at. Q: (Alex Kalinauckas – Autosport) Question to Oscar, please. Just on the final stint when you came out behind Lando, I wonder if you could just talk us through what happened there, why you were a little bit unable to close up the gap despite having a little bit younger tyres. OP: Yeah, I mean, I think the whole race, we were very evenly matched. I think the dirty air made a big difference. I think where I was in the last stint, I don't think it made that much of a difference. I think ultimately, I just wasn't quite as quick as I needed to be in the last stint. So I think that's something that I that I want to improve and, you know, I'm very, very happy with the result, of course, but in terms of leaving the weekend, you know, with the question of am I fully satisfied with my performance today? No, I'm not. And there's still things I want to improve. Yeah, I mean, I think track position made a very big difference today. And I think that's why having the start I did was so critical. Yeah, I think just ultimately, I didn't quite have the pace that I wanted in the last thing. And I still need to go and assess why that was the case. Q: (Florian Niedermair – Motorsportmagazin.com) Question to Lando. Were you allowed to race each other? If you had the pace to attack Oscar, would you have been allowed to do so from team side or was it an agreement to hold position? LN: Yeah, we were allowed to race. Maybe something would have changed in certain positions, but we've always been allowed to race. 99% of our time together we've been allowed to race. There's been a couple times when it's just been better to hold position and it's not been worth anything differently, especially when we're fighting for, you know, last year we were fighting for ninth and tenth and stuff like that, you know, for any driver, it doesn't really matter so much. On a day like today, obviously, it feels better or worse either way, but we've always been allowed to race as McLaren. We've always been able to have those opportunities, and I think mainly because we've always been honest with each other, we've always respected each other well. I think as a teammate, I want to... For myself, I feel like I've always been good and honest and happy and respectful for who I work with and how we can work well as a team. I believe it's a good trait from my side and it's helped me plenty of times in the past. So, yeah, we are allowed to race and into the future that will continue to be the same, I'm sure. Q: (Matt Coch – Speedcafe) Three-part question from him. Is the win everything you'd hoped it would be? What has Mark Webber's role been in your career? And there wasn't a shoey on the podium. Will there be one tonight? OP: Yes, I would say it is. I don't think it's fully sunk in yet. And I mean, I'm not really the kind of person to get overly emotional. So, you know, I don't think you're ever really going to see that from me. But, no, it's an incredible feeling. Like I said, it's something I've dreamed of since I was a kid. You know, we've had a couple of opportunities through the last few races that we've come very close to. And yeah, now to make it happen is an incredible feeling. But I'm sure with more time, you know, I think in Qatar last year, you know, that didn't fully sink in until probably the season ended. And, you know, I think with this, it will probably be a similar kind of feeling. Yeah, it's just quite a cool feeling, but quite hard to, I guess, describe and know how to feel sometimes. The second one was…? Q: Mark Webber. And are you sad that Mark's not here? He's flown back to London to be supporting Mitch Evans, hasn't he? Yeah. OP: Has the Formula E race happened yet? No? It's not happened? Yeah, I mean his influence has been massive on so many levels. I think firstly it's important to say from Mark and Ann it's been important on so many levels. I think behind the scenes they've done an incredible amount of work for me in my career, whether it was my junior career, getting me into Formula 1, working with McLaren, it's been a massive influence for me. I think there's always little tips and things like that. I mean, Mark had a successful career, The majority of it is about the bigger picture of things. And Mark obviously had a long and successful career in Formula 1. And I've said a few times, his hindsight of his career is my foresight. And he can keep me out of a few traps, a few holes that maybe he experienced in his career. His influence there is incredibly important. and you know I think also for myself. he's been in a championship-winning team for a lot of his career and I think you know not just for myself but for the whole team, that's a key thing to have. And the last question? The shoey is Danny Ric’s thing. I mean, I'm going to get roped into it because I'm an Aussie, but I don't know. I'll try and think of something new. No, I think that's gone and done. I know we did one at Silverstone last week, but I think we were a bit upset after the race there, so we needed some cheering up. Maybe we'll do one in the plane on the way back. We can probably pay the cleaning fee now. But no, I'll leave that to Danny Ric and that can be his legacy. I'll create my own. © 2003-2024 Formula One World Championship Limited",,

"NEWS Piastri had a better start than his team mate and squeezed through into the lead on the inside into Turn 1. From there, Piastri was controlling the race and the gap to his team mate through the first round of pit stops. But come the second round, the team opted to call Norris in first, which allowed him to undercut Piastri for the lead of the race. Ostensibly, that decision was made to cover off any threat from behind, but it left the team in an awkward position. They asked Norris repeatedly to cede the lead to his team mate – but Piastri was now four seconds behind. Much cajoling on the radio ensued, until Norris finally slowed down to give the lead back, so that Piastri could claim a maiden F1 win. READ MORE: Piastri admits McLaren team orders made him ‘a bit nervous’ as he reflects on ‘very special’ maiden win in Hungary Oscar Piastri, 1st ""A very, very special day. This is the day I dreamed of as a kid, and to be standing on the top step of an F1 podium, with McLaren, is just incredible. While it may have been a little complicated at the end, I think we got ourselves into a good position at the start and then we were in control from there. I want to thank the entire team for an amazing effort and for giving us such a brilliant car. It’s a hell of a lot of fun racing with McLaren, so I can't thank the team enough for giving me the opportunity to be in F1. To now be winning together 18 months in is an unbelievable feeling."" __Lando Norris, 2nd ""An amazing day for us as a team, and a huge congratulations to Oscar on his first win. I'm so happy, it's been a long journey to get to achieving wins on merit, and that's exactly what we did today. Oscar had a great start and controlled the race from there, so well done to him – it was only a matter of time before he finished first. I can’t thank the team enough for their work and effort to get us here. Let’s keep pushing and fighting for wins each week."" Andrea Stella, Team Principal ""Today is a brilliant day for the team. To finish first and second is a testament to the hard work of every single team member at McLaren, for which I would like to thank them for their efforts and contribution to this incredibly positive result. ""The order of the drivers was altered for the final stint to make the safest call in terms of tyre life and to protect our P1 and P2 finish in case of any problems in the pit stops. Lando giving the position back embodies the values of what it means to be part of the McLaren Formula 1 Team and the culture we instil of being one team and putting the interests of the team first. ""We now keep our feet on the ground, keep building and will not get complacent. There is still a long season ahead and we need to continue to maximise every opportunity available to ensure we keep consistently scoring points and improving the car. We now look to Belgium for one final race before the summer break."" 1 / 3 Russell started on the hard tyre, ran a long opening stint to climb back into the points and didn’t put a foot wrong – bar being undercut by Perez in the second round of stops for seventh. But Hamilton had a more eventful race. He was briefly battling with Norris for third through the opening corners, before settling for fourth. He undercut Verstappen twice to grab third, defending with everything he had to keep the faster Red Bull at bay. The two made contact late on, but Hamilton was able to continue to grab his third podium of the season. Lewis Hamilton, 3rd ""Firstly, a huge congratulations to McLaren on the one-two and Oscar (Piastri) on his maiden victory. They were incredibly strong today and deserved the result. Oscar has been doing a fantastic job ever since he got into F1, been very consistent, and it was only a matter of time before he got a win. ""The team has done a great job to continue making progress with our car. We knew we didn’t have the speed of Oscar or Lando (Norris) today, but we were able to secure the final spot on the podium. It was a challenge at times to keep Verstappen behind whilst also making the tyres last. Our battle at the end was a little hair-raising but that’s motor racing. I’m really happy to be back on the podium and for another solid points haul. We now head to Spa looking to finish the first half of the season on a high."" George Russell, 8th ""Congratulations to Oscar on his victory today. McLaren have been really strong, and he’s been driving really well so it is well deserved. ""We knew after yesterday’s issues in qualifying that we were likely aiming for ‘best of the rest’ today. We struggle a little more in these very hot conditions, so we weren’t quite able to achieve that. The Red Bull of Sergio Perez was quicker than we expected but we gave it a good go to get ahead of him. Getting P8 and fastest lap was still a solid recovery. ""We can also take the positives of the team being on the podium five races in a row. We have made consistent steps forward and the car has been performing much better in recent Grands Prix. Lewis drove a great race today and showed what the car was capable of. It is very close at the front between several teams now. We know we need to maximise every opportunity we have and execute clean weekends to score good points. We will be looking to do that starting next week in Spa."" Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport ""Claiming a podium finish, our fifth race in a row doing so, feels good. The McLarens were very strong today and out of reach for us in these hot conditions. Congratulations to them and Oscar; they deserved today’s victory. We were able to maximise the result with Lewis though and that is encouraging. To see Lewis get his 200th podium in F1, and his 151st with our team, was great. ""Yesterday’s setback with George meant he had to fight through the field. In the end, it was a good recovery from where he started. It was a challenging race for him with plenty of traffic in his pit window throughout much of the afternoon. Without that, he may have been able to claim one more position, but it was still a solid effort. We now head to Spa where the conditions will likely be cooler and hopefully that will suit us a little more."" Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director ""Firstly, well done to McLaren and Oscar. A 1-2 finish is a very difficult result to achieve, and they are setting a very high bar at the moment. ""It was great to see Lewis on the podium today. Going from P5 to P3 was a good achievement considering we had to get ahead of Verstappen to achieve that. We were able to maximise the result with him today as, without incidents, we simply didn't have the pace to race McLaren. ""With George we qualified well out of position yesterday. That denied him the chance to race for much more than the minor points positions. He made a good recovery, coming close to chasing down the Red Bull of Perez, but we'll make sure we take the learnings from yesterday and perform better in future. ""We now look ahead to Spa. We've still got work to do to be right at the front every weekend, but we're moving in the right direction. The energy and enthusiasm in the team is palpable. We've got a few days to regroup and prepare; it will be interesting to see how the W15 responds to cooler conditions than we experienced here in Hungary this weekend."" 1 / 2 Leclerc had a better start than his team mate, who was somewhat baulked by the three-way battle ahead. That saw Leclerc battling with Hamilton for P4, and the Ferrari man later closed in on the Hamilton – Verstappen fight thanks to a good tyre offset. In the end, he was set to settle for fifth until Verstappen’s late off, which earned him one extra place. As for Sainz, he had a lonely race in sixth, off the pace of the cars around him but comfortably ahead of those behind. Charles Leclerc, 4th ""We turned it around today. We had a solid race, with the right tyre management and a good pace. A P4 is not the result we want of course and we know that we have lots of work ahead, however, we were in better form than expected. ""It’s difficult to overtake on this track and we had to manage overheating, being just behind Lewis (Hamilton) on the last stint, which was tricky. We took all our opportunities today and it’s good to bring home these points for the team."" Carlos Sainz, 6th ""A tough race for me. The start was not good and here in Hungary it’s quite crucial. That compromised the first two stints, having to overtake cars to get to P6, and from there onwards it was quite a solitary race. The last stint I could push a bit more after extending with the Hard tyre but overall, as we saw yesterday, we were lacking pace compared to the cars at the front this weekend. Belgium is a completely different track and we have to think what approach we want to take there with the car to try to finish the first half of the season with a good team result."" Fred Vasseur, Team Principal ""First of all, congratulations to McLaren for its great weekend in a Grand Prix that was a wonderful advertisement for Formula 1. On our side, we had a good fight with Mercedes and Red Bull. We got the most out of our package that we could this weekend. We have made a good step in terms of the car’s driveability but now we need to come up with a step forward in performance to close the gap of two to three tenths to McLaren. ""Charles got a good start moving up a couple of places early on. We had a very strong pace in the middle stint on the Hard tyre while it was a bit more difficult at the end on the Medium. With Charles we tried to undercut Verstappen but Hamilton pitted at the same time so we were blocked behind him. ""Carlos didn’t have the best of starts and then he had quite a solitary race bringing home the best result in the circumstances. If we look at the points scored, we were second today behind McLaren. Of course we cannot be happy just with this, but I think we are back on the right track."" 1 / 2 Verstappen had a great slipstream from Norris off the line and went three abreast into Turn 1 with both McLarens. Three into one didn’t go, Verstappen ran wide and returned to the track ahead of Norris – being asked to cede the position a lap or so later. That irked the Dutchman, as did the decision to pit him later than Hamilton twice, allowing him to be undercut on both occasions. A clearly frustrated Verstappen then tried to dive down the inside of Hamilton for the last podium position, locking up and hitting his old Mercedes rival. He bounced into the air, off the track and was lucky to come home fifth. The stewards looked after the race, and decided no further action was necessary. As for Perez, he started on the hard tyre and a long first stint set up his race beautifully, as he recovered into the points from his lowly grid slot. Max Verstappen, 5th “Today was a tough race for us so naturally that frustrated me as I want things to be better. If you look at the whole race I don’t think we were fast enough; we unfortunately just didn’t have the pace and the strategy wasn’t working for us today. The high temperatures on the track also meant that the tyres overheated, especially when we were trying to overtake throughout the race, which was very tough. We got stuck behind cars and let ourselves get undercut and I think we just didn’t have our best day. We had to fight our way back and lost so much time that we lost touch with both the McLarens. As the pace of the car wasn’t as good, we really needed to capitalise on the strategy and we just didn’t manage to do that today. I need to look back at what happened with Lewis but I committed to the move and I don’t think I braked too late but we collided. I don’t think we could have beaten McLaren today but, from qualifying yesterday, I did think that P3 was on the cards, so it is a disappointing day all in all.” Sergio Perez, 7th “I think that was the maximum we could achieve today; overtaking was impossible in the first stint on the hard. It was an aggressive strategy to begin on the hard and it worked well for us, from the start it was about putting it all together, making the right calls and the right progress. My Team had to rebuild the car overnight and it was not one hundred percent on set-up, some correlation was off, so it’s positive I was able to feel at one with the car today and I am getting the feeling back, this is a good boost of confidence. The Team did an incredible job to get the car on track today after my crash, I need to maximise my own performance to match their hard work. The only thing that matters to me is my Team and the people working with me, I have to give my very best to them because they deserve it. I am here keeping my head down; I will keep improving and get back to my form. I think we have the pace to fight at the front, we showed it today and it is just a matter of time until we are back on the podium.” Christian Horner, Team Principal “It didn’t work out for us today. We seemed to have understeer and then losing that position at the start and conceding back to Lando affected us. We tried giving an overlap to give Max the pace but to no avail. The middle sector, in parts of the race was where we were looking competitive but there is plenty for us to look at to try and see how we can improve and come back stronger next weekend. Checo drove a good race today and his strategy, getting the undercut on George, worked well. He also showed good pace, made good overtakes and hopefully would have taken some good confidence from that for a strong performance in Spa.” 1 / 2 Both RB cars had bad getaways and dropped out of the points. Ricciardo was pitted early for some hard tyres, but he then got into traffic which marred his afternoon. Tsunoda manged to extend his first stint on the mediums superbly though despite high levels of degradation, and that set him up for an audacious one-stop race. Making his hard tyres last 41 laps, he came home in ninth place – just holding Stroll at bay on the closing lap to extend RB’s lead over Haas in the championship. Daniel Ricciardo, 12th “Today it was a long and frustrating race. We didn’t use the pace we had in the clear air. We were on the mediums at the start of the race and after only a few laps we pitted for new hards together with the other cars who started on softs, coming out in traffic. It’s even more frustrating because we were quick all weekend, and I felt like we have taken ourselves out of the race so early as we couldn’t fight cars that were coming much quicker on newer tyres.” Yuki Tsunoda, 9th “First of all, huge thanks to the mechanics and team who spent the night and this morning repairing my car in time for the race. It wasn’t easy after such a big crash and we had to change a lot of things, but because of their hard work we were able to score the points today - huge credit to the whole team. I’m very relieved I was able to make up for it after yesterday’s crash and particularly happy with my tyre management. I think it was a big race for us, especially as we were able to finish ahead of our competitors, and it’s a huge positive for the coming races.” Laurent Mekies, Team Principal “Over the past few weeks, everyone in Faenza and Bicester worked hard and effectively, delivering the upturn in performance we witnessed here in Hungary. Getting both cars into Q3 was proof of that, once again heading the midfield and the points we picked up today are a well-deserved reward for all that effort. Yuki’s race was sensational, and we were the only car daring to do a one-stop race, which allowed us to beat not only the midfield runners but also both Aston Martins. Yuki’s tyre management was second to none, and he made it stick to the end. The team also did a truly remarkable job in a short space of time by rebuilding Yuki’s car around a new chassis following his Q3 crash. Unfortunately, we got it wrong with Daniel and pitted him too early in heavy traffic, which lost him a chance to fight for points. His pace had been extremely strong all weekend long, and he demonstrated that again in the final stint of the race when he was finally able to find some free air and fight his way back. We certainly share his frustration, and we will learn and come back stronger next week. Now we move on to Spa, a very different challenge to the Hungaroring. We go there with the positives of our strong weekend here and will push very hard to get our car to work as best it can at this fast and flowing track.” Guillaume Dezoteux, Head of Vehicle Performance “Yuki finished P9 and brought us two precious points which reward the hard work the team has put in overnight repairing his car from the crash yesterday in qualifying. Both cars had a good start but lost positions to the soft runners in the opening laps. Some cars started to pit early, and we reacted with Daniel, which put him in heavy traffic and did not allow him to use his pace. Anticipating his second stop allowed us to gain a few positions back and Daniel could show good lap times, but it wasn't enough to end up in the points for him and he finished P12. With Yuki, we decided to extend the first stint. His good tyre management and the consistency of lap times opened the possibility of doing a one-stop race, which is what we went for. This strategy allowed us to beat the two Aston Martins which is a great achievement, concluding this weekend on a high note.” 1 / 2 Aston Martin went aggressive, starting both cars on the softs. That worked in that both cars made up places – but early pit stops then hampered them later on. Alonso was pitted early again second time around, running out of tyre life late on but Stroll was able to extend his second stint. As such, he had better tyre life late on to fight his way back into the points. Fernando Alonso, 11th “Unfortunately we missed out on the points today and didn't quite optimise our race. We pitted quite early and from that point on we had quite a long race ahead managing the tyres. It's the first long distance we've done with the new package, so we need to go and analyse our new updates and learn more ahead of Belgium next week.” Lance Stroll, 10th “It was a difficult race for us. I don't think we optimised the strategy and we were not competitive enough. We struggled with tyre degradation, too. We've got a lot of work to do as a team ahead of the next round. Spa is a very different track, so hopefully that suits our car more.” Mike Krack, Team Principal “We leave Budapest with a hard-earned point, but there seems to have been potential for slightly more today. Lance and Fernando drove well, making strong overtakes across their stints. The focus now shifts to Spa and we will continue pushing hard to be more competitive next weekend and have a positive finish before the summer break.” 1 / 2 Magnussen had a great start on the softs, Hulkenberg a terrible one – leading to the German pitting at the end of the first lap. That helped him climb through the field, but he lost those places when he had to pit early again. He just about made his tyres last 40 laps late on, coming home 13th on a day where their rivals RB managed to pick up two points in the fight for sixth in the championship. FACTS AND STATS: Hamilton hits 200 podiums as Piastri becomes first winner born this century Nico Hulkenberg, 13th “It was a poor start and a pretty bad first lap that caught us out and put us on the back foot, and when you don’t have track position – which it’s all about around here – it’s very difficult. When you’re running behind in dirty air, you have to try something and push your luck, and an early stop was the answer to that. We then had two huge stints to do with hard tyres, and we knew that would be challenging as we couldn’t make the tyre last long enough. Over one lap, we were pretty competitive but over long runs, not so much, a bit similar to Monaco.” Kevin Magnussen, 15th “We rolled the dice a little bit with the soft tyre start, which a couple of others did, and I gained a lot of positions on the first lap. I got overcut by a few cars and ultimately, we didn’t have the pace today to fight for points. I feel we could’ve done better in qualifying, but looking at the pace today I don’t think we were in the running for points anyway. Still, we take another lesson from this weekend and then we hope Spa is better.” Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal “It was quite a tough afternoon. Kevin had a pretty decent Lap 1, whereas Nico lost positions in the opening lap. From that point on, we needed to get Nico back into the points and try something different, so we pitted early, but ultimately we didn’t have the pace. On Kevin’s side, because his position was P15, we needed to try something different and he had a brilliant lap one getting to P10, but because he was on the soft tyre he still had to pit early. I don’t think it worked really and when you see competitors execute a brilliant one-stop strategy, finishing in the points, we need to look into it. Onto the next race in Spa, and with the level of downforce there, it hopefully will suit us better. We need to regroup and finish the first half of the season on a high before the shutdown.” 1 / 2 Albon had an unlucky day, he was caught in traffic behind the Aston Martins so pitted early, only to pick up more traffic after his stop. Add in a slow second stop, and he was last – doing well to climb back to P14. Sargeant likewise couldn’t make too many moves, despite a late stop for some soft compound tyres. Alex Albon, 14th ""We need to understand what happened today. I think we missed it a little with the strategy; if we didn’t come out behind Fernando on the first stop, we would’ve been fine but as he was playing the team game and helping to back us up to help Lance, it impacted our race. We were planning the two-stop then changed to three-stop, so I started to push the tyres, however, we reverted to two, so you have to extend your stint and by that point, the tyres are gone. We had a great start today and despite being disappointed, we’ve gathered valuable learnings in these hot conditions."" Logan Sargeant, 17th ""Today was okay. I was disappointed with my start and, around here, it’s an uphill battle from there. From a pace perspective, it was a good day and overall, apart from my start, I’m happy with my weekend. The car felt better here than last year, which is a positive, but it was a difficult race. I did my best to come back through as best I could and we tried to be aggressive with stops, but it didn’t really work out and we found ourselves in dirty air, increasing degradation. We’ll keep going and try harder to pull it together in Spa."" Sven Smeets, Sporting Director ""With the cover of clouds disappearing slowly before the race start and the high track temperatures appearing again, we knew it was going to be crucial to find free air and stop at the right moments. Alex had a great start and found himself stuck behind the Astons. Unfortunately, we couldn’t get past Fernando after the first stop, who was working to help his teammate’s race. From then, it became a difficult race for Alex finally finishing in P14. Logan had a difficult start and lost positions, finding himself constantly in dirty air after every stop but showed flashes of good pace throughout his stints. A disappointing afternoon but we have learned a lot again in these hot conditions, making progress since Barcelona which is promising. Now we turn our heads to Belgium which should suit our car much better."" 1 / 2 Kick Sauber opted to split strategies, pitting Zhou with the other gaggle of midfield runners, but leaving Bottas out much, much later. But in the end it didn’t make a difference, with 19 cars finishing and so very little opportunities for the midfield to score. Both two-stopped, but even Bottas’ fresher tyres late on couldn’t make enough of a difference for him to fight back against the Haas of Magnussen again. Valtteri Bottas, 16th ""In the end, there just wasn’t enough action around us to make anything out of this race. Sometimes we got a bit unlucky with the timing of the blue flags, and lost some time as a consequence, but the main issue is still the lack of race pace. We don’t have enough to make it into the top ten on merit and today, with the straightforward race we had in the midfield, we couldn’t go anywhere. The race had actually started ok, but once it all stabilised, we couldn’t keep up with the RBs: we left our first stop quite late to have tyre advantage at the end but, as always, it’s not easy to make progress even when you have tyre advantage. Still, it’s been an overall better performance this weekend than in the last couple of events: the upgrades helped us and will do so in Spa as well, so we need to keep making progress in this direction. The team is improving, but we need to keep pushing all together to make another step forward.” Zhou Guanyu, 19th “This weekend has shown that our one-lap pace made a step in the right direction; however, we don’t see the same in terms of race pace. Today, my race was compromised after the first stop: the early pit stop was to cover our rivals and protect Valtteri, but it didn’t work out as planned. It meant I had to manage my tyres, resulting in a lonely and uneventful race. While the new upgrade package on Valtteri’s car indicates progress, we still struggle with high fuel loads, and neither of us had a chance to make it into the points. Our biggest task now is to stay focused and motivated as a team: we need to understand and learn more about the upgrade package when we both have it after the summer break, so we can start afresh, close the gap, and become more competitive.” Alessandro Alunni Bravi, Team Representative “Today’s race has been quite a difficult one for us: we unfortunately had the confirmation that both our race pace and our consistency across different tyre compounds are not sufficient to fight for the points right now. We knew this from Friday, when the race simulations showed that, compared to our direct competitors, we had more degradation and that we were lacking pace. Today’s race was just not as good as we wanted, although we tried to differentiate the strategies of our drivers, pitting Zhou earlier to potentially create gaps for Valtteri. After the positives we saw in qualifying thanks to the new updates, there is still performance to be found in race trim and especially in dirty air. We saw Valtteri do some overtaking maneuvers, on Ricciardo at the beginning of the race and on Sargeant and Ocon at the end, when he finally ended up chasing Magnussen. It didn’t change the end result for us, but we saw we could fight with our rivals on track. It was hard for Zhou: we chose to pit him earlier to cover Magnussen, Ocon, Alonso and Ricciardo: we knew the second and third stints would be hard for him, but in the end, pace wasn’t there for him either. On a positive note, all four pit-stops today have been consistent and fast: it is testament to the hard work done by our people, mechanics here at the track and design office in Hinwil, to fix the issues we had earlier in the season. With this spirit, which shows we can react and improve with the work of everyone in the team, we need to look forward to the next races. There is still a lot of work ahead of us, but it’s work that will pay dividends not just after the break, but also in 2025.” 1 / 2 Starting Gasly from the pit lane after taking on some new PU components, the Frenchman’s day didn’t improve when he was forced into another retirement with a suspected hydraulics issue. That’s his second DNF in two races, both gearbox related, which is far from ideal. Ocon made a great start though, climbing up through the field. But he lacked race pace and came home down the field after a late third pit stop for some soft tyres. Esteban Ocon, 18th “It was a disappointing day and weekend overall. Apart from the start and the opening laps - where we made up four places - there is nothing too much to say about the race. We need to sit down and review but looking back we probably pitted too early in the first stint trying the undercut and should have extended. Then we needed to box towards the end as the tyres had no grip left. We have plenty of things to analyse and improve on - operationally, performance-wise and reliability - from this weekend. We need a good reset before Spa next week and try to finish on a positive note before the summer break.” Pierre Gasly, DNF “It’s been a frustrating weekend. I started from the Pit Lane after introducing a new battery into my pool of Power Unit components. Our early pace looked promising so we extended the first stint to make up some positions. Our strategy looked like it was going to work out so it feels like we missed a real opportunity as we had to retire the car with a hydraulic leak at the halfway point. It’s a tough end of another challenging weekend for us. We just have to be better and we need to look into our issues and understand why they happen. We move on and we will continue to work on it in order to get on top of these things. We must ensure that we do not repeat these mistakes and come back stronger next weekend in Belgium.” Bruno Famin, Team Principal “After yesterday’s compromised Qualifying, we decided strategically to introduce a new battery to Pierre’s Power Unit pool, which meant he started from the Pit Lane. Pierre did a solid job on his first stint to be in sync with the cars who finished close to the points at the end of the race. We had a hydraulic leak and we absolutely need to get rid of these recurring problems. On Esteban’s side, we were in line with the early stoppers but track position is key at this circuit but we were not able to manage the tyres as well as planned. We have an immediate chance to do a much better job in Spa-Francorchamps next weekend where we must target a positive end before the summer break.” 1 / 2 Mario Isola, Motorsport Director “I think the 310,000 spectators who came to the Hungaroring this weekend and the millions watching on TV and through other channels around the world must have enjoyed themselves. The weekend began like a game of chess and then reached its peak with a very closely contested and open race in which the lead changed hands seven times. “With temperatures pretty similar to those we had seen in Friday’s second free practice session, the Medium probably turned out to be the most efficient compound overall: if it had not been for the collision with Hamilton, Verstappen would almost certainly have finished third. But the Hard, which was definitely the most used compound, was also competitive, not just on the two Mercedes, but on other cars too. In the end, I think this race once again demonstrated how important it is for the teams to carefully work out which are the compounds best suited to their cars, as well as showing how the current range of tyres lets us see how different strategy choices work out on track. After all, that is actually the main objective set for us every year by the FIA, Formula 1 and the sport’s other stakeholders, namely to provide tyres that are first and foremost a guarantee of the maximum possible safety, while allowing the teams and drivers to exploit their potential to the full. That what we try our best to achieve, not just in Formula 1, but also in the two junior categories, for which we are the sole tyre supplier.” HIGHLIGHTS: Enjoy the action from a controversial Hungarian GP as Piastri claims maiden F1 victory © 2003-2024 Formula One World Championship Limited",,
"NEWS Lewis Hamilton was delighted to continue Mercedes’ good run of results by taking the final podium position at the Hungarian Grand Prix, having faced a battle to make his tyres last – as well as engaging in a close scrap with Max Verstappen – en route to finishing in third. After lining up in P5 on the grid, Hamilton had a good start and initially looked to have clinched third from Lando Norris, who had been edged out from pole. While the McLaren soon retook the place, Hamilton remained in fourth and later on snatched third again – this time from Verstappen – thanks to undercutting the Red Bull. READ MORE: Piastri wins Hungarian Grand Prix as Norris belatedly hands back lead in McLaren intra-team drama In the latter stages of the race, Verstappen had caught up with the Silver Arrows car and the former title rivals found themselves in a tense fight. However, the duel came to an end when Verstappen locked up and made contact with Hamilton’s W15, causing the RB20 to bounce in the air and leave the track. While this dropped the Dutchman down to fifth – as well as leading to him being investigated by the stewards for the incident – Hamilton continued on to take P3 behind the McLaren duo of Oscar Piastri and Norris. As well as congratulating the Woking-based outfit – with whom he had started his F1 career – along with Piastri for claiming his debut Grand Prix victory, Hamilton also praised his own team for their continued progress.     2024 Hungarian Grand Prix: Verstappen and Hamilton collide after battle for P3 boils over “Big thanks to this amazing crowd this weekend and a huge congratulations to McLaren on the one-two – that's my old original family, so really happy to see all the boys, the whole team back up front,” Hamilton commented after stepping out of the car. “For us today, the team has done a great job to continue on with pushing this car. Ultimately we didn't have the pace of the McLarens or of the Red Bulls, but we just were able to hold on at the beginning of the race. HIGHLIGHTS: Enjoy the action from a controversial Hungarian GP as Piastri claims maiden F1 victory “It was very, very tough to hold on, make those tyres last, and obviously the close battle we had at the end was a bit hair-raising but that's motor racing. I'm really happy and grateful for the points. Big thanks to the team.” Asked if the battle with Verstappen had been nerve-wracking, the seven-time world champion responded: “It's not nerve-wracking. I think when you see the pace at which they closed the gap in certain corners, you just laughed to yourself because it's not something I can do – particularly in the last sector they were very, very strong, same as the McLarens. “I saw him coming from a long way back and he was able to brake a lot later than me. But he sent it up the inside, I stayed still, and he clipped the wheel and went over, so I think a racing incident.”     Russell 'hoping for P7' despite strong pace in Hungarian Grand Prix On the other side of the Mercedes garage, George Russell managed to recover from a difficult qualifying – which resulted in him lining up in P17 on the grid – to ultimately end the race in eighth place. This put him one position behind Red Bull’s Sergio Perez, who had also had a tough Saturday and started the race from P16. “We were hoping for P7, to be honest,” Russell said of his end result. “Checo [Perez] had a really great race, we were a bit surprised by his pace, and on paper we thought we’d be about 50 to 60 seconds behind the leader – we ended up 40 seconds behind the leaders, so we’ll take the very small positives. FACTS AND STATS: Hamilton hits 200 podiums as Piastri becomes first winner born this century “Happy to see Lewis on the podium, congrats to Oscar as well on his first win.” While his own weekend was not without its challenges, Russell acknowledged that it was positive to see the Silver Arrows score their fifth consecutive podium of the season at the Hungaroring. “We can argue that from these five weekends, this [in Hungary] has probably been our least competitive, and obviously Lewis on the podium today which is a great result for the team,” the 26-year-old added. “Clearly that was… in the normal circumstance of qualifying, we’d have been up there fighting for that P3 to P5 mix. Still disappointed after yesterday, but that’s the sport – you make mistakes, you get punished.” © 2003-2024 Formula One World Championship Limited",,

"POLL It's the talking point that was on everyone's lips after Oscar Piastri sealed his maiden Grand Prix victory in Hungary: should McLaren have implemented the team orders they did and asked Lando Norris to make way? The 23-year-old Australian is now officially the 115th driver to win a World Championship Grand Prix, but he needed his team mate's co-operation in order to get there, having lost out at the second pit stops when Norris was brought in first. READ MORE: Piastri wins Hungarian Grand Prix as Norris belatedly hands back lead in McLaren intra-team drama McLaren then made the call to re-establish the previous order, after Piastri's exemplary getaway at the start which saw him lead for much of the race at the Hungaroring.

"NEWS Max Verstappen has called on Red Bull to “be more on it” after a frustrating Hungarian Grand Prix that saw McLaren take a comfortable one-two – with Verstappen finishing down in P5 following contact with old rival Lewis Hamilton. Starting P3 on the grid, Verstappen’s race got off to a bad start as he ran wide at Turn 1, the extra tarmac in the run-off area actually allowing him to get ahead of Lando Norris before race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase asked him to hand the place back to the McLaren driver in order to avoid a penalty. READ MORE: Piastri wins Hungarian Grand Prix as Norris belatedly hands back lead in McLaren intra-team drama What followed was a long and ill-tempered afternoon for the reigning champion, who was vocal on team radio after getting undercut twice by his rivals – at one point telling Lambiase, after being chided for overworking his medium tyres after his final stop, “No mate, don’t give me this s*** – you guys gave me this s*** strategy, okay? I’m trying to rescue what’s left.” “Of course not happy,” said Verstappen after making his way to the media pen post-race. “On a day where of course we’re already lacking pace compared to McLaren, you try and of course hope that we do the right things with the strategy, which today was not the case. The first [stop], to be undercut – it was not ideal, but maybe – you know – you get caught out, okay.     2024 Hungarian Grand Prix: Verstappen protests on the radio – but lets Norris past for P2 “Then again they leave me out [in the second round of stops] where I basically immediately got into traffic with backmarkers. And on a day where the car’s not the quickest, you need to try and capitalise on undercuts… You can’t rely on a little pace advantage. “Maybe last year, yeah, with the car being quite a lot faster than everyone else. But I think in the position that we’re in now, we can’t do that anymore and I think that’s why today was a tough race for us. “Naturally of course that frustrates me because I want things to be done better because of course I’m realistic – today, we couldn’t have beaten the McLarens but a P3 I think was on the cards if we would have just been on it a bit more.” READ MORE: Piastri admits McLaren team orders made him ‘a bit nervous’ as he reflects on ‘very special’ maiden win in Hungary Asked what changes needed to be enacted at Red Bull, meanwhile, Verstappen replied: “We need to work. I mean, it’s not like suddenly next weekend [in Spa] we can have new upgrades on the car, so yeah, it is a problem. “We know that we’re lacking compared to McLaren and it’s of course not nice, but we have to analyse our stuff, how we can improve our overall package currently. But I don’t think that’s something very easily done, you know? We’ll see next week how it will evolve, but at the moment, I think race pace, qualifying pace – we are behind [McLaren].”     2024 Hungarian Grand Prix: Verstappen and Hamilton collide after battle for P3 boils over Verstappen’s mood wasn’t improved after a dramatic coming-together with Hamilton at Turn 1 seven laps from the end as the pair were squabbling over P3 – Verstappen tipped into the air after clipping Hamilton’s right-front wheel, an incident that the stewards looked at after the Grand Prix, before ruling that no further action was required. “I went for a move that was fully on,” reckoned Verstappen, “but then in the middle of the braking zone, when I’m already committed of course to the move, he suddenly just keeps [moving] right, and if I wouldn’t have turned while braking straight, I would have made contact with him. So I went in the air. AS IT HAPPENED: Follow all the action as Piastri wins the 2024 Hungarian Grand Prix “People always make a lot about what happened in Austria, ‘it was not correct’, blah blah blah,” added Verstappen, of his controversial crash with Lando Norris two races ago. “But that’s on the initial move and then you just brake straight and you hold the wheel quite straight. And I feel like now it was not on the initial move but afterwards, during the braking zone [Lewis] keeps turning right – you cannot do that when someone’s committed to the inside. “That’s why I locked up, because otherwise we would have collided anyway, because he would have just turned in on me.” Verstappen could only finish fifth in Hungary     Verstappen: Red Bull 'should have done a better job' with strategy Asked, meanwhile, whether he planned to apologise to his team for his irate radio messages, Verstappen demurred: “I don’t think we need to apologise. We just need to do a better job. I don’t know why people think that you cannot be vocal on the radio. This is a sport, you know? If some people don’t like that, then stay home.” HIGHLIGHTS: Enjoy the action from a controversial Hungarian GP as Piastri claims maiden F1 victory With Oscar Piastri leading McLaren’s one-two, team mate Lando Norris closed the gap to Verstappen in the drivers’ fight down to 76 points – with the Belgian Grand Prix up next week. © 2003-2024 Formula One World Championship Limited",,

"NEWS Lando Norris has opened up about what he was thinking when he let Oscar Piastri overtake him for the lead – and race victory – in the latter stages of the Hungarian Grand Prix, with the Briton admitting that, while it was “tough”, he knew he had to “do what was right”. After Piastri got ahead off the line at the race start, Norris had to settle for P2 during the first phase of the race while his McLaren team mate held a steady lead. However, the picture changed when Norris was pitted first during the second round of pit stops, seemingly to cover off the threat from Lewis Hamilton behind. READ MORE: Piastri wins Hungarian Grand Prix as Norris belatedly hands back lead in McLaren intra-team drama This meant that, after Piastri subsequently made his visit to the pits, Norris had become the new race leader. As such, the team asked the latter to “reestablish the order”, but this was something that Norris seemed reluctant to do as the gap remained too large for Piastri to catch up.     2024 Hungarian Grand Prix: Piastri snatches the lead as Norris drops to third on the race start Following extensive discussion over the radio, Norris slowed enough for his fellow McLaren driver to pass on Lap 68 of 70, meaning that Piastri led them home in a one-two formation. Giving his initial thoughts on the result, Norris spoke of his joy at seeing the squad take first and second place, commenting: “[I’m] happy for the team. I don’t know when our last one-two in a race was, but probably over 10 years ago or something! DRIVER OF THE DAY: Piastri gets your vote after maiden F1 win in Hungary “Just super happy, I’m happy for Oscar too – I know he won in Qatar [in the Sprint last year], but I think he’ll also say that this win is a lot more than a Sprint win. ""His first proper win, it’s a special moment, so [I’m] happy for him and for the whole team. An incredible weekend for all of us so, yeah, super happy.” Norris followed a team instruction to allow Piastri through to reclaim the lead in the last laps of the race When pushed on just how difficult his decision-making had been regarding the call to let Piastri past, Norris shared an insight into his emotions and how he eventually realised that he should allow his team mate through. “It’s tough, but I know what Oscar’s done for me in the past,” the 24-year-old conceded. “I think this is a little bit different but, yeah, at the same time I got told to let him past and I did. It’s always tough when you’re fighting for a win, and a win means so much to me and also to him. MUST-SEE: Old rivals Verstappen and Hamilton touch in fight for P3 “Yeah, I just had to try put myself in his shoes and understand it that way. Every driver’s selfish and you have to be selfish in this game but, when you’re just thinking of your own benefits, you’re only thinking of the good things. But of course, I put myself in his shoes and I realised I had to do what was right.” © 2003-2024 Formula One World Championship Limited",,

"VIDEO     Oscar Piastri claimed the maiden Formula 1 Grand Prix victory of his career at the 2024 Hungarian Grand Prix – but there was plenty of controversy en route for the McLaren team. Piastri had enjoyed a superb launch off the line to jump his pole-sitting team mate Lando Norris and run P1 in the opening part of the race. READ MORE: Piastri wins Hungarian Grand Prix as Norris belatedly hands back lead in McLaren intra-team drama But a decision to pit Norris ahead of Piastri at the final round of stops created an awkward situation for McLaren, who were forced to plead with Norris to swap positions back with his young team mate – the switch only coming two laps from the end, to allow Piastri to claim his first Grand Prix win. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton survived late contact with old rival Max Verstappen to claim his own 200th podium in Formula 1.

"NEWS Oscar Piastri became the eighth-youngest winner in Grand Prix history with victory at the Hungaroring. But the Australian – the first F1 winner to be born inside the 21st century – had to overcome some tense team order calls involving McLaren stable mate Lando Norris to claim his maiden triumph. Starting P2 on the grid, Piastri reacted brilliantly off the line, resisting the muscling of pole-sitting team mate Norris to lead out of Turn 1, before controlling the early part of the race. READ MORE: Piastri wins Hungarian Grand Prix as Norris belatedly hands back lead in McLaren intra-team drama But after McLaren allowed Norris to take the lead by making his second stop ahead of Piastri – to protect against attack from behind – there were tense moments as Norris then appeared to resist calls to let his team mate back in front. The swap was finally made two laps from the end however – with Piastri going on to add to his Qatar Sprint win from 2023 with his first ever Grand Prix victory, much to the Melbournian’s delight. “It’s very, very special,” said 23-year-old Piastri. “This is really the day I dreamed of as a kid, standing on the top step of an F1 podium.     2024 Hungarian Grand Prix: Piastri snatches the lead as Norris drops to third on the race start “Obviously a bit complicated at the end but I put myself in the right position at the start, and thank you to the team for an amazing effort, and amazing car. “It’s a hell of a lot of fun racing for McLaren, so I can’t thank them enough for giving me the opportunity to be in F1, and to be able to win together 18 months in is an incredible feeling.” DRIVER OF THE DAY: Piastri gets your vote after maiden F1 win in Hungary Asked about the position swap with Norris – who at one point engaged in a heated and emotional debate with race engineer Will Joseph about the ethics of the position change, at a time in the season when Norris is the closest rival to championship lead Max Verstappen, who could only finish P5 after clashing with rival Lewis Hamilton – Piastri said: “The longer you leave it, the more you get a bit nervous. “But no, it was well-executed by the team and I think it was the right thing; I put myself in the right position at the start and with the different strategy we had – yes, my pace probably wasn't as quick as I would have liked in my last stint, but I was still in the right position to make it happen, so well-executed from the team. “I’m incredibly happy for the whole team – and nice to get my first one on the board.” Piastri admitted that team orders calls in the final part of the race had made him ""nervous"" Piastri will now head to the Spa-Francorchamps track where he secured P2 in the Sprint last year – with the Australian saying that McLaren were full of confidence currently, after the team secured their first one-two since the 2021 Italian Grand Prix, the two papaya cars having finished almost 15 seconds up the road from closest rival Lewis Hamilton at the Hungaroring. “[The car is] a beast at the moment – it's fast in every condition,” chuckled Piastri. “I think today, we had it under control completely and an amazing feeling to just be able to manage the race like that with both cars and secure a one-two. AS IT HAPPENED: Follow all the action as Piastri wins the 2024 Hungarian Grand Prix “I think we've proven this year that we can be quick in any circuit, any condition – we're always there at the front. Spa's not been the happiest of hunting grounds for us recently but I'm confident we'll be strong. “We've got a car that's become a real all-rounder, so I'm super-confident and I think the rest of the team should be as well.” McLaren’s 43 points from Budapest, meanwhile – on a day Red Bull could only score 16 – sees them jump ahead of Ferrari to P2 in the standings, just 51 points behind Red Bull. © 2003-2024 Formula One World Championship Limited",,
