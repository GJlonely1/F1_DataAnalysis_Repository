"Oscar Piastri is now officially a Grand Prix winner, having taken victory in the Hungary on his 35th race start. But while he may still be relatively new to Formula 1, the Australian has been impressing across the motorsport ranks from an early age.After starting his karting career back home, Piastri faced the daunting step of moving to Europe aged just 14 to pursue his racing career in England. From there the teenager flourished, clinching victory in his debut Formula 4 race at Brands Hatch.READ MORE: Piastri admits McLaren team orders made him ‘a bit nervous’ as he reflects on ‘very special’ maiden win in HungaryMore success followed, with Piastri claiming consecutive championship titles in Formula Renault Eurocup, Formula 3 and Formula 2 in 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively, before an infamous battle for his F1 services played out between Alpine and McLaren.It was the latter for whom the young hopeful eventually made his Formula 1 debut in 2023. And while many might have struggled with the pressure in such a situation, Piastri displayed a cool and calm demeanour as he continued to impress at the Woking squad.Hit play on the video above to watch how Piastri’s journey to becoming an F1 race winner unfolded.",,
"Pierre Gasly has called on Alpine to “stop allowing missed opportunities” after recording his second non-finish in a row, having been forced to retire from the Hungarian Grand Prix owing to a suspected hydraulics issue.It was a tough weekend for the Enstone-based squad, with Gasly and team mate Esteban Ocon qualifying on the back row after a strategic error from the team resulted in them not putting a final lap in during Q1. Gasly then started the race from the pit lane due to set-up and power unit element changes being made to his A524 ahead of the Grand Prix.READ MORE: Piastri wins Hungarian Grand Prix as Norris belatedly hands back lead in McLaren intra-team dramaWhile the Frenchman did make some ground come Sunday afternoon, his race was over before the halfway point, and the 28-year-old voiced his disappointment about missing out on the battle for points when speaking to the media afterwards.“It’s too many issues, too many problems,” said Gasly. “It’s a massive shame because we started from the pit lane, we [were] actually in front of Fernando [Alonso] at that stage of the race, our strategy worked perfectly with what others decided to do.“I think we put ourselves in contention for one or two points, and… today it’s hydraulics, yesterday was the strategy, last week I didn’t race at Silverstone because of the gearbox.",,
"Bringing Lando Norris in two laps before his race-leading team mate Oscar Piastri for their second pit stops created something of a drama for McLaren in Hungary.Such is the high tyre degradation this track imposes, the earlier stop undercut Norris – who had been less than 2s behind – ahead. His new medium tyres were so much faster than the 27-lap old hard tyres on Piastri’s car.",,
"McLaren boss Andrea Stella says that far from being upset with Lando Norris’ initial refusal to follow instructions from the pit wall and let his team mate past for victory on Sunday, he would have been “very concerned” had the Brit simply waved Oscar Piastri through without a word of complaint.Pole-sitter Norris dropped behind team mate Oscar Piastri when Sunday’s encounter at the Hungaroring got under way, with the Australian managing to build a comfortable advantage and maintain the lead through the opening round of pit stops.READ MORE > MONDAY MORNING DEBRIEF: Why did McLaren pit Norris before Piastri – and did they really need to?However, with McLaren later feeling threatened by the power of the undercut from cars behind, they elected to bring Norris in for fresh tyres before Piastri during the second sequence of stops – leading to the two cars swapping positions given the pace offset.Piastri was told by his race engineer not to worry about the development, with Norris being asked to move aside and relinquish P1 given that he had gained it in the pit lane, only for the Briton to initially question the call and show some reluctance.Eventually, via several pleas from engineer Will Joseph that included being reminded about McLaren’s pre-race meetings, Norris backed off and allowed Piastri through, but it was a moment that sparked plenty of debate amongst onlookers.",,
"Charles Leclerc was ""relatively happy"" after taking P4 in the Hungarian Grand Prix – his best result since winning in Monaco back in May – but was left concerned Ferrari are slipping further back from the current pace setters.Having lined up in sixth on the grid, Leclerc at one stage found himself closing in on Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen’s battle for third. While Hamilton remained ahead – and Verstappen slipped down to fifth following contact between the two world champions – Leclerc crossed the line in fourth.READ MORE: Piastri wins Hungarian Grand Prix as Norris belatedly hands back lead in McLaren intra-team drama“I’m relatively happy,” the Ferrari driver said after the race. “I mean, I’m never happy with a P4 but if you do a step back, considering the tough few races I’ve had in the last few weekends… We came here saying we need to maximise the team points, we need to maximise the car, and I think we did that today, so on that I’m happy.“On the other hand, I’m not happy because the performance is not where we want it to be. McLaren is quite a far bit ahead now, Red Bull was a bit closer than what we thought today. But I think we had a pretty good race pace, we were just a bit stuck because it’s a track where you cannot really overtake.”",,
