"Oscar Piastri took his first Grand Prix victory at the 35th attempt – but it was tense afternoon for the Australian as he waited for McLaren team mate Lando Norris to hand back the lead, which he'd lost as a result of pit stop strategy.While McLaren had their best result since Monza 2021, others left Budapest pondering what might have been. Lawrence Barretto picks out his winners and losers from an enthralling Hungarian Grand Prix...Oscar Piastri has had a few near misses of late – but he was not to be denied in Hungary as an excellent getaway to snatch the lead opened the gateway to secure his first Grand Prix win.The Australian, 23, is the first race winner born in the 21st century, the fifth Australian to stand on F1’s top step and the 115th driver to win a World Championship Grand Prix.READ MORE: Piastri admits McLaren team orders made him ‘a bit nervous’ as he reflects on ‘very special’ maiden win in HungaryThis was his third podium in six races and second top-two Grand Prix finish in the last three events.

"Daniel Ricciardo could not hide his frustration after an RB strategy call backfired in the Hungarian Grand Prix, resulting in the Australian dropping down the order and out of the points.The race had looked to hold some promise for Ricciardo after qualifying, where he secured a grid slot of P9. However, after slipping backwards at the start come Sunday, the 35-year-old was then brought in for an early pit stop to swap from his medium tyres to new hards.READ MORE: Piastri wins Hungarian Grand Prix as Norris belatedly hands back lead in McLaren intra-team dramaThis resulted in Ricciardo emerging back out into traffic – amid several cars that had pitted for softs – and from there he struggled to make much ground before ultimately crossing the line in P12.When asked about the idea that pitting so early could potentially undo his race, Ricciardo responded: “You wondered right, I thought the same thing honestly as soon as I… you don’t want to pull into the pits – you get the call and you know this isn’t the thing to do.“But you get the call late and there’s no time to question it, because then if you miss a lap, it’s even worse. But as soon as I pulled in, the cars on softs had pulled in, I was on a medium – [we should have thought] let’s go, let’s use our clear air we’ve got.",,
"Toto Wolff says Mercedes are hoping for a return to cooler temperatures next weekend in Belgium after Mercedes’ two-race winning streak came to an end in the heat of Hungary.With the warm conditions not favouring the W15 as much as cooler climes, the Silver Arrows were not quite able to match the pace they displayed during their victorious weekends in Austria and at Silverstone.READ MORE: Hamilton thrilled with podium in Hungary after ‘very tough’ race as he reflects on ‘hair-raising’ battle with VerstappenHowever, Hamilton got the most out of his afternoon at the Hungaroring, a track that he has won at a record eight times. Despite struggling to make his tyres last during the final stint – as well as facing a feisty scrap with Max Verstappen for P3 along the way – the Briton held on to take the third spot on the podium behind winner Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris.Hamilton's team mate George Russell, meanwhile, started from down in P17 after errors from himself and Mercedes during qualifying, leaving him with work to do on race day.

"Max Verstappen was outspoken throughout the Hungarian Grand Prix in Budapest, voicing his opinions on the team’s chosen strategy, his car's performance and his rivals' driving.It led to some eyebrow raising radio exchanges between the Dutchman and his Race Engineer Gianpiero Lambiase – but Team Principal Christian Horner was swift to dispel any rumours of a rift when he spoke to the media after the Grand Prix.Verstappen's frustrations began at the very first corner of the opening lap when he felt he was pushed wide by Lando Norris. But running second, the team asked him to give the place back to the McLaren man or risk face a penalty.He was then undercut twice by Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes on a day where the undercut was powerful and track position was king, before late contact between the pair dropped the Dutchman from fourth to fifth at the flag.READ MORE: Piastri admits McLaren team orders made him ‘a bit nervous’ as he reflects on ‘very special’ maiden win in HungaryBut speaking after the race Horner insisted he had no concerns about his driver's approach to the race, or to team communications.",,
