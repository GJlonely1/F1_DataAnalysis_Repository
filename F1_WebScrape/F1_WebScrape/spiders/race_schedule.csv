"NEWS Formula 1 is in Belgium ahead of the 14th race weekend of the season, and Pirelli have confirmed what tyres will be in use at Spa-Francorchamps. F1‚Äôs official tyre suppliers have chosen the mid-range C2, C3 and C4 compounds for the historic, 19-corner venue, mirroring their choices from the last two years. READ MORE: 5 Winners and 5 Losers from the Hungarian Grand Prix ‚Äì Who drove brilliantly in Budapest? Drivers will get two sets of the hard tyre (marked white), three sets of the medium tyre (yellow), and eight sets of the soft tyre (red), as well as the green intermediate tyre and the blue full wets, should they be required. Plenty of work has taken place at Spa between the 2023 and 2024 race weekends, with much of the track having been resurfaced, meaning another factor for teams and drivers to evaluate during practice. Previewing the weekend ahead, Pirelli noted: ‚ÄúIn terms of stress on the tyres, it is one of the tracks with the highest average levels, even if it does not reach the peaks seen at Silverstone and Suzuka. ‚ÄúThe track features all corner types, linked by very fast sections, which makes it difficult for the teams to identify the ideal aerodynamic compromise. ‚ÄúIn fact, it is not unusual to see cars that are very strong in the fastest first and third sectors, struggling in the second slower one, or vice versa. TECH WEEKLY: How Red Bull‚Äôs Hungary upgrades aim to solve an inherent conflict in F1‚Äôs ground effect cars ‚ÄúSome combinations of corners, for example, Eau Rouge-Raidillon are very demanding and have unique characteristics, in this specific case a strong compression which puts a lot of stress on both the driver and the car. ‚ÄúUsually, degradation at this track is mainly thermal, but the new surface could be a decisive factor in this area, given the extra grip afforded to the tyres. ‚ÄúFinally, how can one discuss a race weekend at Spa-Francorchamps without taking the weather into consideration? If there is a single venue on the motor racing calendar, not just F1, where variable weather can play a role, it is this one.‚Äù For more information about Pirelli‚Äôs F1 tyres, visit pirelli.com. ¬© 2003-2024 Formula One World Championship Limited",,

"FEATURE Special Contributor One race to go before the August break, and Oscar Piastri‚Äôs victory in Hungary continued the competitive nature of the season as he became the seventh different winner in 13 races. Who will come out on top at Spa-Francorchamps is just one of many intriguing aspects heading to Belgium... That‚Äôs right, we‚Äôre back into the realms of talking about a championship fight, even with big margins in the drivers‚Äô standings. Part of the uncertainty between Lando Norris and his team about whether Norris was going to return a position to Oscar Piastri in Hungary was due to the British driver admitting he still feels like he has a chance of beating Max Verstappen to the drivers‚Äô championship this year. And the stats actually back him up. READ MORE: 5 Winners and 5 Losers from the Hungarian Grand Prix ‚Äì Who drove brilliantly in Budapest? Norris is currently 76 points behind Verstappen ‚Äì over three full race victories ‚Äì but more than half of that advantage (39 points) was built up across the first two races. Verstappen won in both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia when McLaren‚Äôs launch-spec car was not overly competitive, but since a major upgrade was introduced in Miami the points difference between the two has been just 26 points in total. Things are heating up in both the drivers' and constructors' championships It‚Äôs much closer in the constructors‚Äô championship, though, where the McLaren one-two in Hungary closed the gap to Red Bull by 27 points to just 51, while Ferrari also edged a bit closer and are now 67 points behind. Also at play is a potential power unit penalty for Verstappen this weekend, with Spa-Francorchamps a circuit where he has carved his way through the field from similar grid drops in the past. Team principal Christian Horner recently admitted a penalty was highly likely at some stage this season, but it remains to be seen if this is the race Red Bull opt to take it. TECH WEEKLY: How Red Bull‚Äôs Hungary upgrades aim to solve an inherent conflict in F1‚Äôs ground effect cars There was a lot of focus on the strategic calls from both McLaren and Red Bull during the Hungarian Grand Prix weekend, and the respective responses from the drivers. But one thing that shouldn‚Äôt overshadow is the wider competitive situation, as Red Bull failed to score a podium for the second time in three races, and set their longest run without a win since the end of the 2021 season. Far from being used as a stick to beat Red Bull with, that statistic should highlight just what an incredible run of success the team have been on, and the consistency they have shown. But they are now consistently being challenged, and every now and then that‚Äôs going to lead to an imperfect weekend. A lot of focus remains on Sergio Perez and his future With a lot of focus on his future, Sergio Perez crashed in Q1 at the Hungaroring, and while his strategy and strong drive helped him recover to seventh, Verstappen was frustrated at what he felt was not the ideal strategy as he ended up fifth. Whether the strategy was right or wrong, the focus intensifies when a previously dominant team stops winning with regularity. With a proven history of huge success on so many occasions, write-off Red Bull at your peril, but they‚Äôre facing a tougher dynamic than in recent seasons. READ MORE: Horner hopes Perez will ‚Äòtake confidence‚Äô from Hungarian GP ‚Äì but warns inconsistency ‚Äòneeds to change‚Äô There is so much that makes Spa-Francorchamps an iconic track on the Formula 1 calendar, with the stunning location, the remarkable elevation changes, mix of corners and committed fans just a few of the aspects that play a part in its standing. Add in the ability for the weather to play a central and challenging role, and the venue in the Ardennes Forest has delivered multiple special races in the past, and F1's newest winner ranks this as his favourite track on the calendar. ‚ÄúIt's a very fun circuit,‚Äù Piastri said. ‚ÄúIn the junior categories, it was always quite good for racing and should be in F1 as well. And just a nice flowing layout. Spa-Francorchamps is an iconic track on the Formula 1 calendar ‚ÄúLet's be honest, there's never really going to be a track like Spa again, through the middle of a forest and I think that definitely adds to the atmosphere of it and the undulation and stuff like that. We're not going to have racetracks like that again. So I think that's why it's so special.‚Äù We‚Äôve been able to enjoy multiple different winners and unpredictability so far this season ‚Äì with no driver winning more than two races in a row ‚Äì and Spa-Francorchamps certainly offers the potential for that trend to continue. WATCH: How Oscar Piastri stormed the junior categories and became an F1 winner Hungary saw another piece of the driver market move ‚Äì even if there was nothing firmly falling into place as a result ‚Äì as Kevin Magnussen‚Äôs departure from Haas at the end of the season was announced. Magnussen doesn‚Äôt currently have a confirmed drive for 2025 and so is on the market for a team wanting to add experience to their line-up, while Haas have also yet to publicly state who will replace the Dane next year. Meetings might take place away from prying eyes but as it‚Äôs the last time that the paddock will come together before the mid-season break, it‚Äôs also often the weekend when future talks are outlined and teams and drivers plan out final discussions. That can lead to whispers about potential moves, as everyone involved try to understand the complex driver market picture as best as possible before they head their separate ways for a few weeks. Kevin Magnussen will be leaving Haas at the end of the season Such a competitive season is set to take a short pause through August, with teams having to partake in a mandatory two-week shutdown at some stage between Spa-Francorchamps and the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort. With 14 races completed and another 10 to go, it‚Äôs an important time to rest and recharge before the final two European rounds and then the return of flyway races. But it also makes Belgium carry that little extra bit of importance given the fact that a good result will send a team off in high spirits, while a poor one will linger through the summer. Using Red Bull and Verstappen as an example, as explained above, the narrative after Hungary is of a slightly frustrated partnership given the McLaren one-two and focus on strategic calls. But this is still a team and driver that lead both championships, and will be enjoying the break in a much more positive fashion if they end with a well-executed race rather than a challenging one.

"NEWS Alex Albon has shed light on the frustrated radio message he was heard making to his Williams race engineer during the Hungarian Grand Prix, when he accused the team of being ‚Äúindecisive‚Äù. Having made a good start from P13 on the grid, Albon eventually found himself caught up in a queue of cars behind the Aston Martin duo of Lance Stroll and Fernando Alonso. but a request to change his strategy drew a curt response from the Thai driver, who eventually finished outside the points in 14th. After his engineer told him: ‚ÄúSo Alex, we‚Äôre now thinking you‚Äôre going to have to go to plan B,‚Äù Albon responded, ‚ÄúYeah but I don‚Äôt appreciate when you do that, and now my tyres are dead. We‚Äôre just too indecisive!‚Äù READ MORE: Piastri wins Hungarian Grand Prix as Norris belatedly hands back lead in McLaren intra-team drama Asked about the message after the race, Albon joked: ‚ÄúI think this is the only thing that must have gone on TV! Everyone‚Äôs been asking the same question! It wasn‚Äôt that bad, was it?‚Äù Reflecting further on the reasons behind it, the 28-year-old continued: ‚ÄúIt was only because we had a great start, and I thought, ‚ÄòOkay, perfect, we‚Äôre in a fight for points.‚Äô We had very good pace in the first stint as well. Albon explains feisty radio message during Hungarian GP ‚ÄúWe tried to undercut Fernando but we couldn‚Äôt, we didn‚Äôt, and I think that was the deciding factor, because if we got past Fernando we would‚Äôve not been held back by Fernando. Fernando was playing a good team game, he bunched up the whole group to allow Lance to pit and extend his stint. ‚ÄúAnd then we went from a two-stop to a three-stop, and then in the middle of that strategy call we went back to a two-stop, so I kind of used up all my tyres ready for the three-stop, ready to be boxed, and then I just got left out. HIGHLIGHTS: Enjoy the action from a controversial Hungarian GP as Piastri claims maiden F1 victory ‚ÄúObviously they know better than me, but just in terms of the tyres, they took a punishing for no reason, basically.‚Äù Pushed on whether there were still positives to take from the weekend, Albon responded: ‚ÄúYeah, there is. There‚Äôs a definite positive trend, if you look at Barcelona to here, tracks that are quite similar, and we‚Äôve done really well, considering. So, it‚Äôs relative, but I‚Äôm happy.‚Äù ‚ÄòThat start haunts me‚Äô says Sargeant after run to P17 in Hungary As for team mate Logan Sargeant, the American had had a decent qualifying ‚Äì lining up in P14 on the grid ‚Äì but struggled off the line come race day before eventually ending the Grand Prix in P17. ‚ÄúThat start haunts me!‚Äù Sargeant said with a laugh when speaking to the media after the Grand Prix. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just so, so on the limit and I slightly overstepped and didn‚Äôt move, so I don‚Äôt even know where I ended up, but it was way back there and that just made the race an uphill battle. FACTS AND STATS: Hamilton hits 200 podiums as Piastri becomes first winner born this century ‚ÄúPace-wise I think it was okay, we tried to get aggressive with stops, tried to get some undercuts, didn‚Äôt quite work out, so that ends up making it even worse because you‚Äôre stuck in dirty air for longer stints. ‚ÄúBut, yeah, it is what it is. I think apart from that start I‚Äôm happier with my weekend, so just got to keep going and hopefully put everything a little bit better together in Spa.‚Äù ¬© 2003-2024 Formula One World Championship Limited",,

"FEATURE Staff Writer Sir Nick Faldo spent the 1980s and 1990s tearing up the fairways and greens of golf courses all over the world, but he also had an unlikely role in F1 history ‚Äì sharing the Silverstone circuit with Michael Schumacher at the very start of the German‚Äôs career in the top echelon. Ahead of this year‚Äôs Belgian Grand Prix, the event in which Schumacher made his full F1 debut for Jordan, the six-time major champion remembers that special day with F1.com‚Ä¶ It was last year that Faldo and Schumacher‚Äôs names were mentioned together in the press, thanks to the charismatic Eddie Jordan ‚Äì founder and owner of the eponymous F1 team ‚Äì telling listeners of his Formula For Success podcast an unusual story. READ MORE: 8 amazing facts about Schumacher‚Äôs legendary F1 debut Suddenly missing half of his 1991 line-up when Bertrand Gachot went to prison for an altercation with a taxi driver in London, Jordan had to act quickly to find a replacement and opted for Mercedes-backed youngster Schumacher, who had been racing for the brand‚Äôs World Sportscar operation. With the Belgian Grand Prix looming, Jordan was keen to squeeze in a test to give Schumacher some valuable F1 experience but, according to the Irishman, the Silverstone track chosen had already been booked on the only day both the driver and team were available. Schumacher arrived on the F1 scene in 1991 when Jordan needed a new driver The party supposedly responsible? Golfing icon and car enthusiast Faldo, along with his Porsche 959. But what does the former world number one remember of that day? BEYOND THE GRID: Bertrand Gachot on the prison sentence that handed Michael Schumacher his F1 debut While his version of events differs slightly, the fact remains that Faldo shared the track day with a Jordan F1 car and, unbeknownst to him, a future legend of the sport was at the wheel of it. ‚ÄúI think Eddie added a little bit of poetic licence,‚Äù chuckled Faldo, when asked about Jordan‚Äôs recollection, before explaining how the day at Silverstone unfolded from his perspective. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very good friends with John Fitzpatrick, who was a Porsche Cup winner, had his own team, drove 962s and that sort of thing‚Ä¶ I had a 959, so Fitzy calls me and says, ‚ÄòHere, I‚Äôve got a deal for you‚Äô, because he was clerk of the course at Silverstone. Schumacher had caught Jordan‚Äôs eye with his performances in junior single-seaters and sportscars ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòJordan are practising, they‚Äôve rented the track, just them on the track. If you come down, very simply when they‚Äôre on the track, you‚Äôre off, because they come in and out, so you can sneak out and have a couple of laps‚Äô. ‚ÄúI drove down and we went to the workshop first, to see Eddie, with the [F1] car sitting there and everything. We didn‚Äôt know what was going on [with their test]. GALLERY: Mick Schumacher drives father‚Äôs first F1 car ‚Äì the Jordan 191 ‚Äì at Silverstone ‚ÄúBut I went out on the track, Fitzy drove me for a couple of laps, which was great. I did exactly as they said, ‚ÄòOff you go‚Äô. I‚Äôd do probably half a dozen laps, they‚Äôd give me a wave, I‚Äôd come in and woosh, off would go this Jordan, clipping it around. ‚ÄúThen they‚Äôd [Jordan] come in again, I‚Äôd get a nod, and I did this backwards and forwards a good six or eight times in the day. How cool is that?‚Äù Faldo‚Äôs experience would get even cooler when Jordan pulled him to one side and offered up the opportunity of a lifetime ‚Äì the chance to drive the 191 F1 car he had watched storming around the track. Faldo got a feel for the car Schumacher would make his F1 debut in at Spa-Francorchamps It was one Faldo and his 1.91-metre frame initially had reservations about. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, Eddie says to me, ‚ÄòDo you want to have a go?‚Äô,‚Äù Faldo continues. ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòOh no, I‚Äôm all right‚Äô. You know what Eddie‚Äôs like, he said, ‚ÄòWhen the f**k do you think you‚Äôll get in an F1 car?‚Äô. I said, ‚ÄòOh, all right‚Äô. READ MORE: Top 10 moments of Michael Schumacher brilliance ‚ÄúThey put me in it and I had to take my shoes off, I‚Äôd got no seatbelt‚Ä¶ What scared me was they jammed the steering wheel in and it‚Äôs on my knees. I wish they‚Äôd told me, ‚ÄòJust hit that button to pull it off‚Äô, but I was in. ‚ÄúAs you know, it was the start of the paddle [shift] era, so you lift up the clutch and it goes off at 4,000 revs ‚Äì it‚Äôs off. Then I had three laps, which were hilarious!‚Äù Faldo could hardly contain himself as he continued to recall his whirlwind run around the British Grand Prix venue.     10 Moments of Schumacher Brilliance - Belgium 1991 ‚ÄúI tootled out, did a lap like, ‚ÄòWhat the heck is this?‚Äô, then came to the straight, and I‚Äôll never forget thinking, ‚ÄòOkay, I‚Äôll give it a squeeze‚Äô,‚Äù Faldo laughs once more. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only in third [gear], so I give it a squeeze, and the only way I can describe it is it goes off like a catapult! ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt accelerating like it‚Äôs a car, it just went boing, and it was gone. That‚Äôs the scary bit, the instant pick up ‚Äì it‚Äôs ridiculous. It‚Äôs probably even more frightening now. EXCLUSIVE: Watch ‚ÄòMichael Schumacher ‚Äì The Making of a Legend‚Äô on F1 TV ‚ÄúAnyway, it‚Äôs very bumpy, and if you hold the steering wheel light, you let it ride the bumps, and if you hold it tight, because you‚Äôre scared‚Ä¶ the thing is like wiggling. ‚ÄúI literally held my breath, gave it a squeeze. You suddenly go 120 mph or something, but it was more the wobble that scared me. ‚ÄúThen I breathed out into my visor and completely fogged it up. Like an idiot, I put my thumb under the visor, pulled it out an inch, and of course the air comes in all over me! I kept going and was getting a little bit better. Schumacher qualified a fine seventh on debut, only for his clutch to fail during the first lap of the race ‚ÄúYou went down the main straight, did the big right, came down the hill and there was the little left, right‚Ä¶ I was getting quite good in the Porsche standing on the brakes, turning as hard as I could, getting a bit of tyre squeal and powering it. ‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd try the same [in the F1 car], so I came over this hill, stood on the brakes and it literally went zoom. I was 50 yards short of the corner and the thing‚Äôs nearly stopped ‚Äì the brakes, everything, it was scary. READ MORE: 6 times the best F1 drivers and best cars combined to produce relentless brilliance ‚ÄúI came in and Fitzy said my eyeballs were distorted‚Ä¶‚Äù After removing himself from the car and taking a breather, Faldo began to realise what had just happened. A pro golfer turned F1 test driver on home soil at the iconic Silverstone circuit. Surely it couldn‚Äôt get any better? Well, fast forward a few decades and the story would take another wild turn. Until recently, Faldo was unaware that Schumacher had tested alongside him at Silverstone Settling in to watch the Schumacher documentary, which was released in 2021, Faldo noticed something strange when Jordan popped up and offered a few words about his newest prospect. ‚ÄúIt was a great day,‚Äù Faldo reflects further. ‚ÄúThen, of course, I‚Äôm watching the Schumacher documentary and Eddie‚Äôs talking, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve got this young lad, put him in the car, gave him a test run‚Äô, and I went, ‚ÄòHang on a minute!‚Äô SCHUMACHER: 8 of the biggest revelations from Netflix‚Äôs documentary on the seven-time F1 champion ‚ÄúHonestly, we didn‚Äôt know. I suddenly go, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt believe it, the young kid who was being tested was bloomin‚Äô Schumacher‚Äô. We didn‚Äôt see him. He was in and out, [so] I didn‚Äôt even see him for the day. He came in, put his helmet on, did a session, then disappeared. ‚ÄúIt made the whole story even better to think, ‚ÄòWow, I was right at the start of Michael Schumacher‚Äôs career in F1‚Äô. That is very, very cool for me.‚Äù Strangely, though, it was not the first time that Faldo had mixed with an F1 star of the future. Schumacher went on to achieve 68 pole positions, 91 race wins, 155 podiums and seven world titles in F1 ‚ÄúThe other funny one was at the Festival of Speed at Goodwood,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMy boy Matthew and I, we had lunch with a young lad called Lewis Hamilton! He was unknown, had just got a chance to start his career, hadn‚Äôt even done a race, I don‚Äôt think, and we had lunch with him. ‚ÄúAnd another one‚Ä¶ I did [BBC TV quiz show] A Question of Sport a million years ago and the young guy who hadn‚Äôt driven yet was Nigel Mansell. I said, ‚ÄòWhat do you do?‚Äô, and he was doing touring cars and had got an F1 drive ‚Äì so I was with all of these guys right at the beginning!‚Äù BEYOND THE GRID: Sabine Kehm on life in Michael Schumacher‚Äôs inner circle A fan of motorsport in general, Faldo also has some hair-raising stories of passenger rides alongside his friend and former World Rally Champion Ari Vatanen ‚Äì including one time ‚Äúmy stomach hit the roof‚Äù on the gravel of Bagshot‚Äôs army assault course. But it‚Äôs the F1 tale that he ‚Äúdines on‚Äù as he travels the world with golf, letting everyone know about the day he drove on the same tarmac as Schumacher and then had a run in his car. When he‚Äôs not playing or talking about golf, Faldo keeps a close eye on the F1 world And while his golf commentary schedule keeps him busy, Faldo and his family ‚Äì based in North America ‚Äì still find time to watch the current crop of F1 racers battling it out. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in Montana, so we get up at whatever, five in the morning, to watch the race,‚Äù he explains. READ MORE: Michael Schumacher named ‚ÄòMost Influential Person in F1 History‚Äô after fan vote ‚ÄúI [see] Eddie every now and then, and I think that‚Äôs how it all started [with this story coming out]. We bumped into each other and were telling the story, then Eddie‚Äôs on his podcast and what have you. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been to a race for ages because it never fitted with my TV schedule in America. I probably will go to one in the future, probably in the Middle East. I did a Monaco Grand Prix moons ago as a guest of BMW, so that was quite fun, and I think I did the very first Austin race. ‚ÄúBut we love F1. We‚Äôre huge fans; we‚Äôve always been huge fans.

"NEWS Christian Horner has praised Sergio Perez's drive in Hungary as one of his strongest races in several rounds, whilst also acknowledging that the Mexican‚Äôs lack of consistency across all three days of a race weekend ‚Äúneeds to change‚Äù. It was an event of ups and downs for Perez, who arrived at the Hungaroring in need of a good result after some tough weekends of late. While he performed well during Friday‚Äôs practice sessions, the 34-year-old suffered a disastrous Q1 exit in Saturday‚Äôs qualifying, with a crash into the barriers putting him out of the running and leaving him in P16 on the grid. READ MORE: Piastri wins Hungarian Grand Prix as Norris belatedly hands back lead in McLaren intra-team drama Despite a slow start to the race, Perez made ground as the afternoon progressed and eventually crossed the line in P7 to finish one place ahead of George Russell in the Mercedes. Reflecting on the six-time race winner‚Äôs pace in Hungary, Horner said: ‚ÄúCheco‚Äôs race actually starting on the hard [tyre], he dropped behind Russell, but as soon as he got into clean air after that first pit stop, his pace actually was very similar to McLaren. Perez recovered from a tough qualifying to finish the Hungarian Grand Prix in seventh place ‚ÄúSo he‚Äôs driven a good race today and the strategy with Checo, getting the undercut on George, and going a bit earlier worked really well for him. He had good pace, made some good passes and hopefully will take some confidence out of this.‚Äù With Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris taking a one-two result for McLaren ‚Äì while Max Verstappen finished in fifth following late-race contact with Lewis Hamilton ‚Äì Horner admitted that it is crucial for Red Bull to score more points at the next round of the calendar in Belgium. READ MORE: ‚ÄòI want things to be done better‚Äô fumes Verstappen after Hungarian GP as he admits Red Bull now behind McLaren ‚ÄúMcLaren obviously have a lot of pace at the moment, they had a big score today and we obviously need to start scoring big points from next weekend onwards,‚Äù the Team Principal added.     Perez reveals his car ‚Äòwas not 100%‚Äô in Hungarian GP after qualifying crash To do this, the team will need Perez to qualify in a higher position on Saturday. Horner is hopeful that the driver‚Äôs good performance on Sunday at the Hungaroring may help him to feel more confident going forward. ‚ÄúThat was probably Checo‚Äôs strongest race since China [in April], I would say, so yeah he should take some confidence out of today‚Äôs race,‚Äù said Horner. ‚ÄúIf he‚Äôd have qualified more in position, you‚Äôd have seen he would have been in a much more competitive position.‚Äù MONDAY MORNING DEBRIEF: Why did McLaren pit Norris before Piastri ‚Äì and did they really need to? However, when pushed on the fact that Perez has struggled to be in this position for all three days of a race weekend, Horner conceded: ‚ÄúYep, and that‚Äôs something that needs to change.‚Äù ¬© 2003-2024 Formula One World Championship Limited",,

"NEWS The Formula 1 Commission met for the third time in 2024 on Tuesday, with the headline outcomes including ruling out changes to the world championship points system and agreeing nine days of pre-season testing for 2026 to coincide with new regulations. A proposal to hand out points beyond 10th place was discussed at the meeting in London, which was chaired by F1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali and FIA Single-Seater Director Nikolas Tombazis. READ MORE: FIA unveils Formula 1 regulations for 2026 and beyond featuring more agile cars and active aerodynamics The FIA said in a statement that it was ‚Äúunanimously agreed‚Äù that there will be no changes to the distribution of championship points. With new aerodynamic and power unit regulations being introduced for 2026, which include the use of 100% sustainable fuels and a greater focus on electrical power, teams will be given significantly more days of pre-season testing. The current allocation of three days will be increased to nine, split across three days, to give the teams a chance to iron out any niggles with their all-new machines. The locations and dates are still to be determined. The Commission also agreed that the minimum weight for a driver will be increased by 2kg to 82kg ‚Äúin the interests of well-being‚Äù. That means the minimum weight of the car without fuel will be increased to 800kg for 2025.     2026 Formula 1 Regulations Explained The FIA added the strategic objectives of the 2026 regulations were ‚Äúreiterated setting out that the overriding aim is to achieve fast and closer racing that will continue to engage and excite fans‚Äù. The governing body added: ‚ÄúAn update was provided on the timeline of the 2026 Regulations covering Technical, Sporting, Financial and Environmental matters and that the ongoing collaboration led by the FIA with all the teams was on track to meet the objectives and moving in the right direction for the finalisation of the regulations. EXPLAINED: From more agile cars to 'X-mode' and 'Z-mode' ‚Äì unpicking the 2026 aerodynamics regulations ‚ÄúFollowing further discussions during upcoming Technical and Sporting Advisory committees, an update on the 2026 Regulations relating to sporting and technical regulations will be presented at the World Motor Sport Council on October 17. An extraordinary F1 Commission meeting will take place on October 2 to discuss 2026 matters.‚Äù Regarding the financial regulations, it was agreed costs relating to maternity or paternity leave, sick leave and team entertainment will ‚Äúremain excluded‚Äù from the cost cap.

"FEATURE F1 Correspondent & Presenter Just four months after expanding their commitment to Formula 1 by completing a full takeover of Swiss operation Sauber, Audi have moved to make sweeping changes to the senior leadership team ahead of their arrival in the sport in 2026. In comes Mattia Binotto, who has been out of F1 since leaving Ferrari at the end of 2022, and out goes CEO Andreas Seidl and Chairman of the Board of Directors Oliver Hoffmann. READ MORE: Audi announce former Ferrari chief Binotto as new F1 boss as Seidl departs It‚Äôs a remarkable turn of events given Seidl only joined the project at the start of 2023 after a long chase from the German manufacturer that resulted in him parting ways with McLaren. However, after 18 months in the job ‚Äì and only four months after he was officially given the Audi F1 Team CEO title ‚Äì Audi have decided he isn‚Äôt the right person to lead the project. Andreas Seidl was brought in from McLaren last year, but is now leaving the project Sauber are enduring a miserable season so far. The Swiss outfit are the only team to have failed to score a point all year and thus sit bottom of the constructors‚Äô championship. While the squad secured Nico Hulkenberg‚Äôs long-term commitment to the Audi project from 2025, they have so far failed in their bid to get number one target Carlos Sainz to put pen to paper. READ MORE: Audi expands commitment to Formula 1 with 100% takeover of Sauber Seidl has tried to stay out of the limelight since taking the job, instead preferring to work behind the scenes at the factory to create a plan to build up and restructure the operation while letting Alessandro Alunni Bravi be the face of the team at race weekends. However, it is believed Audi did not feel that Seidl was doing a good enough job, quickly enough and thus decided to part ways. There have been changes in the upper echelons of Volkswagen/Audi since Seidl first started talking to them about coming onboard, including Gernot Dollner replacing Markus Duesmann as CEO last September. Sauber will become the Audi works team in 2026 And just four months after Oliver Hoffmann moved from head of Audi‚Äôs Technical Department to the newly-created position of General Representative, Audi decided to part ways with him, too. Discussions between Audi and Binotto have been going on for some time now with the Italian ‚Äì who spent 27 years with Ferrari ‚Äì keen to find a path back to Formula 1 as he had unfinished business. READ MORE: ‚ÄòSo far, we have achieved all the targets‚Äô ‚Äì Audi provide update on 2026 power unit development After taking some time out he embarked on a role with Italian automotive company TEXA ‚Äì however, he kept his eye on F1 and sources say he had talks with Aston Martin, and Alpine, as well as Audi. Ultimately, the German manufacturer‚Äôs foray into F1 proved to be exactly the project he wanted ‚Äì something he could build up from scratch using his near three decades of experience at Ferrari, which included having great success heading the engine department. Binotto will take on the newly-created role of Chief Operating and Chief Technical Officer, in charge of running the Formula 1 team, which in theory should give him the support to implement his plan. Mattia Binotto has decades of F1 experience after almost 30 years with Ferrari It is likely Binotto will spend the coming months assessing the infrastructure and team before working out how he wants to build out the structure of the outfit. Only recently, Audi announced a significant number of job advertisements as they look to grow the workforce by several hundred to match the firepower of F1‚Äôs big teams. READ MORE: Hulkenberg ‚Äòvery excited‚Äô by Audi project as he sees opportunity for manufacturer to be competitive ‚Äòstraight away‚Äô In making the decision now, Binotto will have 18 months to finalise preparations for Audi‚Äôs full arrival into Formula 1 in 2026. Company chiefs hope his appointment can help the team speed up their rebuild and preparations, their recruitment of a second driver for 2025 and beyond, and improve the fortunes of the Sauber team in the short term to ensure Audi can be competitive as soon as possible in F1. ¬© 2003-2024 Formula One World Championship Limited",,

READ MORE: Allison explains how ‚Äòpretty bloody good‚Äô Antonelli is developing and if he‚Äôs ready for F1 Rather than moving to F3 for 2024, he was placed in F2, the category directly below F1, with a solid run of early-season points finishes paving the way for breakthrough Sprint and Feature Race wins at Silverstone and the Hungaroring respectively. Asked after last weekend‚Äôs Budapest triumph what his recent F2 successes are going to do for his F1 chances, Antonelli replied: ‚ÄúAbout next year, I don‚Äôt really want to think about it because nothing is official, so I don‚Äôt know anything, to be honest.     Formula 2 Highlights: 2024 Hungarian GP Feature Race ‚ÄúThe goal is to do the best season in F2.

"NEWS Audi have announced former Ferrari Team Principal Mattia Binotto is returning to Grand Prix racing as the new leader of their Formula 1 project. Earlier this year German car maker Audi took full ownership of the Sauber team, which will be run under the Audi banner from 2026, with an all-new power unit currently being developed in-house in Germany. READ MORE > ANALYSIS: Why Audi have turned to former Ferrari man Binotto to lead their F1 charge Binotto, 54, will assume leadership of the operation on August 1, as Chief Operating and Chief Technical Officer based at the Sauber factory in Hinwil, Switzerland, and will report directly to the board of directors. As part of the restructure, former McLaren Team Principal Andreas Seidl ‚Äì who joined Sauber in January 2023 and was CEO of the Audi team ‚Äì is leaving, along with Audi executive Oliver Hoffmann, who was overseeing the project. Binotto was Chief Technical Officer at Ferrari until being promoted to Team Principal in 2019. He left Maranello in 2022 after three years in the job, and having been with the Scuderia since the mid-1990s. As part of the restructure, Andreas Seidl is leaving the project ‚ÄúI am delighted that we have been able to recruit Mattia Binotto for our ambitious Formula 1 project,‚Äú said Audi CEO Gernot Dollner. ‚ÄúWith his extensive experience of more than 25 years in Formula 1, he will undoubtedly be able to make a decisive contribution for Audi.‚Äú READ MORE: ‚ÄòSo far, we have achieved all the targets‚Äô ‚Äì Audi provide update on 2026 power unit development Explaining the restructure, Dollner added: ‚ÄúOur aim is to bring the entire Formula 1 project up to F1 speed by means of clear management structures, defined responsibilities, reduced interfaces, and efficient decision-making processes.
