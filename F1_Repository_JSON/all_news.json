With the session taking place on a damp track after heavy rainfall earlier on at Spa-Francorchamps, the drivers were faced with tricky conditions as the session played out. Given that, Norris was left satisfied with his end result, having also felt that he had not been driving at his best. READ MORE: Verstappen claims P1 in Belgium qualifying ahead of grid penalty with Leclerc to start race from pole ì[It was] tough, but Iím honestly pretty happy with today,î the Briton said after the session. ìI think, in the end, me and Oscar were split by half a tenth or something. ìClearly we were lacking comparing to the cars ahead ñ especially the Red Bull, the Red Bullís another level comparing to us in the rain and even in the dry they were probably still a bit stronger. ìA tough day, I expected worse and Iíve not been driving particularly well, just one of those days where itís not clicking.

But Iím hoping that maybe with a slightly lower downforce setting that we chose today comes back into our favour tomorrow.î HIGHLIGHTS: Watch the qualifying action from Spa as Verstappen goes fastest while Leclerc inherits pole Piastri echoed Norrisí thoughts on the challenging session, with the Australian admitting that it had been ìdifficultî. ìI think our pace looked reasonable at times, or looked quite good at times Iíd say,î he explained. ìI think in Q3 maybe we got the tyre strategy a little bit wrong, but I think itís so hard to predict. ìItís still raining now and not really making anything wetter, so itís just very difficult to predict how much itís going to rain, how much itís going to affect you, and we did the safe thing. In the end maybe it wasnít quite the right move, but still not a bad effort.     Piastri insists ëwe can still fight for the winí despite missing out on top grid spot ìWe still got two cars through into what will be the top five tomorrow, and I think Spa is definitely a track where you can overtake and make progress. Our dry pace looked competitive and I think we can hopefully show that tomorrow.î Piastri also acknowledged that suffering a slight moment in the session may have compromised him slightly, having commented: ìYeah, it hurt me a bit.

Q: So do you think the conditions today, the fact we had the mixed conditions out there ‚Äì and it looked tricky from the driver's point of view ‚Äì do you think that helped you make the difference today? CL: Yeah, I think that without this rain, probably P5 was the position we were fighting for, with the Mercedes especially. But obviously with the rain, it helped us a little bit. But I'm not going to complain. I'm really happy. I'm very happy with the lap in Q3. And it's good to be back on the front part of the grid. But now we've got to finalise that tomorrow. Q: And tomorrow you'll be starting from pole. What's your approach going to be going up through Eau Rouge on that first lap if you're still in the lead? Because it could be a tricky race to lead the first lap around here. CL: Yeah, it's not the easiest first place to keep on the first lap here. But honestly, I will see it. Every start is different. And then once I'll be in the car tomorrow through Eau Rouge, I'll decide what's the best thing I can do. But obviously, I'll try to keep that first place. Q: Good luck for tomorrow. CL: Thank you very much. Thank you. Q: Max Verstappen, another pole position for you this weekend. Unfortunately, you won't line up in pole position because of the grid penalty. But talk us through that lap because that was exceptional out there. Max VERSTAPPEN: Yeah, it was a nice qualifying. Luckily, the weather was okay. It was just raining a little bit, but at least we could do a decent qualifying. Yeah, everything worked well. Every tyre set that we were on, we could just do good lap times. I was, of course, also thinking about Q3, not knowing if it was going to dry out, so I was trying to keep two new sets for Q3, and luckily we escaped in Q1, Q2, so... Yeah, very happy. I mean, the car was working quite well in the wet. Yeah, I could just do my laps and try to do clean lap times in the wet, which is always quite tricky. But tomorrow, of course, I know that it's quite a different day. It's going to be warmer, normally no rain. So it's all about tyre degradation. And, yeah, we just need to make sure we're good on that. I know that, of course, I have to start also ten places back, so this was the best I could do today. And then go from there. I don't know how quick we're going to be. I hope that we can be in the mix, you know, to try and move forward. Q: Coming into this weekend, you probably knew within the team that you were going to take this grid penalty and make the decision that you have. You've started out of position here in Spa. What's your approach going to be down into Turn 1? Because it's a tight corner. It can really get a bit chaotic at times there. MV: Yeah, the race can be lost, of course, in Turn 1, so just need to see what happens, you know, in the start, naturally, and just go from there. It's a very long race, it's very hard on tyres, and just need to try and manage that as good as we can, and hopefully then we can be competitive tomorrow. Q: It's been a couple of races since you've won a Grand Prix. Starting where you are tomorrow, do you think you can bounce back after last weekend and get a race victory? How quick is your car in race trim? MV: We are not making it easy on ourselves, and especially, of course, in the battle that we're in. I know that today was a great day, but it's in the wet. We need to be quick in the drive tomorrow. But yeah, it's going to be a tough battle. Yeah, we'll try to do the best we can. Hopefully, we can battle the Ferraris and the Mercedes, of course, ahead. And if we have a bit of luck, of course, maybe we can challenge the McLaren. PRESS CONFERENCE Q: A very warm welcome to the fastest three drivers in qualifying for the FIA Formula 1 Belgian Grand Prix. In third place, Sergio P√©rez. In second place, Charles Leclerc. And fastest in Q3 once again here at Spa, Max Verstappen. Well, very well done, Max. You were extremely quick in all conditions. How hooked up were you and the RB20 today? MV: Yeah, it was a good day. Of course, yesterday we tried a few things with the car. I think we learned from that. And today we tried to put on the car what we thought was best. And I think, as you could see, we ran maybe also a little bit more downforce compared to some competitors. So naturally, of course, in the wet, probably it's a little bit more stable and that can help, of course, around here. But overall, I think the laps were good in qualifying all the way from Q1 to Q3. I passed Q1 and Q2 only on one tyre set, so I think that was important because that gave me, of course, a better opportunity for Q3. Yeah, everything was working well, but, of course, today is not as important because tomorrow is going to be dry, it's going to be warmer, and we need to be good on tyres and, of course, starting 10 places back. It is going to be, of course, a little bit more tricky. I don't expect it, of course, to be like the last two years. Naturally, looking at the cars around us being quite quick. So, yeah, we'll just try to move forward, try to fight Ferraris, Mercedes, and with a bit of luck, maybe the McLarens, but it all depends on our pace ourselves. Q: Max, one question about Q3. You were six tenths faster than anybody else after the first runs. Why did you go out again? Was it just to be sure? MV: I had another tyre set, so I was like, let's try and go faster. I'm not sure what happened. I was very close to my lap time in places, like gaining, losing. Maybe it just rained a little bit more and it just didn't give me the same grip. But I mean, both laps are almost identical. So when you have the tyres, I mean, you can try and get a better lap out of it. Q: You've said who you hope to be battling with in the race tomorrow. Just strategically, what is going to be your approach? MV: Survive lap one and just go from there. I mean, we also have a bit of a different tyre strategy to the other cars, so we have to wait and see how that will evolve in the race. But, yeah, we'll see what we can do. I mean, I'm not as confident as I was the last two years around here in coming back to the front. I still see it more as a damage limitation race. That's how it is. But at least today was the best possible we could do in terms of the starting position for tomorrow. Q: Are you more confident in the car here than you were at the Hungaroring last weekend? MV: I think overall the balance is a bit better, yeah. If it's going to be enough to be the quickest, I'm not sure. But yeah, hopefully we can just have it all a bit more under control. Q: Alright, very well done today. Charles, let's come to you now, tomorrow's pole sitter. But let's talk about Q3. You pulled together a beautiful lap right at the end of the session. Just how good was it? CL: It was a good lap. As Max said, the rain picked up a little bit at the end of Q3, which maybe there was a bit more to find on the first part of Q3, but obviously anyway, P1 was out of reach for us today. It's a lot better than what we expected coming into the weekend, and especially after yesterday, that was a very difficult day for the team once again. So yeah, the tricky conditions helped us today. Q: What about the asphalt? So much of it is new this year. How was that performing in the wet weather? CL: I mean, the old asphalt seems to be drying up pretty quickly, whereas the new asphalt a little bit slower. So that was a little bit tricky. But all in all, it was fine. I think there was quite a good grip on the new asphalt, which made it quite fun to drive in wet conditions. Q: So, Charles, let's throw it forward. Pole position. Are you more confident coming into this race than you were at the same point last year? CL: I cannot remember about last year. Too long ago, and so many things have happened since then. Then for sure, if we are looking for tomorrow, it's going to be a tricky race for us. It will be dry conditions. And on dry conditions recently, we've been struggling a little bit more. However, the McLaren is a bit further away than what we wanted. There's Checo right behind. That will be the main target, and then we'll see how it goes after the first stint. But it's a good starting position. It's also a track where you can overtake quite easily, so we'll need the pace, and that we‚Äôll only have the answer tomorrow. 1 / 5 Q: Very well done. Thank you. And Checo, well done to you as well. That was a great qualifying session for you. Are you much happier with the car this weekend? SP: Not initially. We tried a lot of things. We kept throwing things at it. And it's never ideal when you don't have progression. And once again, today we threw at it a lot of things. I think we found a nicer window, a little bit similar in the direction of Hungary. But we were a lot happier with the car, so I think‚Ä¶ Although, I mean it's on Inter conditions but the balance in the medium high-speed was feeling positive, in the right direction. So let's see tomorrow. I think tomorrow is going to be a very different day and let's see where how much we are able to improve. Q: Given that you only just crept through Q2 were you surprised by your pace in Q3? SP: I think already I was quick in Q1, Q2. The problem was our run programme. We finished a lap before everyone. I think I was P4 or something. But then, you know, when you give a lap away, everything was really, really close. So we were very lucky to be able to make it. I think it was, yeah, it was definitely a mistake on our run programme to left us vulnerable, basically. Q: Alright, and just your thoughts on the performance of the car in the dry? SP: I think yesterday McLaren looked very strong. But at the same time, we are not that far away. So we've done some changes in the direction of tomorrow. So we'll see. I think after the first stint, we will have a good idea. QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR Q (Christian Menath ‚Äì Motorsport-magazin.com) I think you went for the bigger rear wing as the one you had in FP1. Some people might think it's a strange choice given that you have the 10-place grid penalty, but is it the case that with the DRS effect so big nowadays that it doesn't make a huge difference in the race then? MV: I felt a bit more confident and comfortable on the FP1 wing. So I hope that that is also going to be the case tomorrow. Tomorrow is a bit warmer as well, so naturally probably a bit more sliding. I just hope, yeah, that it's better for me. But when you look at the McLaren, for example, they run a very skinny wing. Seems to work for them, but it didn't really work for me yesterday. So yeah, bit of a different strategy also there. And I guess we'll find out tomorrow how it will work out. I mean, I have to pass cars. The DRS effect is quite big around here, but at the end of the day, I think it's more important just to be good on tyres around here. Because if you're good on tyres, you can pass people. Q: (Scott Mitchell-Malm ‚Äì The Race) Checo, after the last couple of months, I think this is your best qualifying result since China. How kind of satisfying is that for you, given the criticism that you've had, the fact that Red Bull has said that they wanted to have some conversations over the summer break? It's perfectly timed. And I think, as Tom alluded to, it could have been so different had that run plan cost you in Q2. SP: From my point of view, it doesn't change anything. You know, I've always said it's not where we are now, it's how you ride the waves and where we finish in Abu Dhabi. I mean, there are a lot of drivers that haven't been able to maximise their performance lately, but obviously, the scrutiny on my side has been quite a bit higher. It doesn't change anything from my point of view. I think tomorrow is a new day, a new opportunity. It would have been the same if I was knocked out in Q2. Tomorrow is a new opportunity to do better. And it's the way I see it. It's tomorrow what really counts. And if I don't have a good race tomorrow, I will try to have a good one in Zandvoort. It's how it is, this is a sport and sometimes it goes your way, sometimes you have to fight and nothing goes in your direction, but I think it's just the nature of the sport. Q: (Jake Boxall-Legge ‚Äì Autosport) Another question for Checo. Obviously, fantastic result today, really good race in Hungary as well. Do you feel like confidence is starting to come back to you after, I guess, a very difficult period for you? SP: More than confidence, I mean, it's not like I forgot how to drive, you know, from five, six races ago. It's just that you see it with a lot of drivers. Sometimes you're not able to maximise the full potential of your car. And for that reason, you end up lacking that, let's say, confidence to extract the maximum out of the car you have. I think we've been taking good step forwards in the right direction since Hungary. I think Silverstone was already quite good, I had a really good Friday. So I think the season‚Ä¶ The car is going in the right direction for now and hopefully tomorrow we are able to finish it off with a strong result. And still, there is a long way to go in the season. So yeah, just head down and I think like I've said before, you know, the team and myself are focusing on and what we‚Äôve got to do. At the end of the day it's getting the most points we possibly can and the rest couldn't care less to be honest. Q: (Carlo Platella ‚Äì FormulaPassion.it) A question for Max and Sergio. How much do you think today result is due to track, weather conditions or a different set-up strategy? MV: I think it's all down to the drivers! SP: Confidence. MV: No, well, like I mentioned before, we run a bit more downforce, so for sure that is good for today. One lap pace is of course important, but it's more important t},{"story_name": "Gasly pays tribute to ëhonest and transparentí Famin as Alpine boss prepares to step back from F1 duties", "story_url": "https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/gasly-pays-tribute-to-honest-and-transparent-famin-as-alpine-boss-prepares.31yaC2ne908fSvrxbChSSp"},{"story_content": "RACE 02 13 20 NEWS Max Verstappen is anticipating a ìtough battleî ahead in the Belgian Grand Prix, despite the Dutchman going fastest in qualifying by half a second before being dropped down to P11 owing to an engine penalty. Verstappen went quickest during the first runs of Q3 on a time of 1m 53.159s, sixth tenths clear of Red Bull team mate Sergio Perez. The impressive lap went unbeaten and ñ while Charles Leclerc beat Perez into P2 ñ Verstappen remained in P1, a position he will not keep due to the 10-place grid drop. READ MORE: Verstappen claims P1 in Belgium qualifying ahead of grid penalty with Leclerc to start race from pole ìThat was a nice qualifying,î the reigning world champion commented afterwards. ìLuckily the weather was okay ñ it was raining a little bit but at least we could do a decent qualifying. Everything worked well, every tyre set that we were on we could do good lap times. ìI was also of course thinking about Q3 not knowing if it was going to dry out, so was trying to keep two new sets for Q3 and luckily we escaped Q1 and Q2 so, yeah, very happy. The car was working quite well in the wet, so I could just do my laps and try to do clean lap times in the wet, which is always quite tricky. ìBut tomorrow I know itís going to be quite a different day. Itís going to be warmer, normally no rain, so itís all about tyre degradation and we just need to make sure weíre good on that.     2024 Belgian GP Qualifying: Max Verstappen and Red Bull celebrate his P1 lap in Q3 ìOf course I have to start 10 places back, so this is the best I could do today and then go from there. I donít know how quick weíre going to be, I hope we can be in the mix to try and move forward.î Asked how he will approach Turn 1, Verstappen explained: ìRaces can be lost into Turn 1, so [we] need to see what happens in the start naturally and just go from there. Itís a very long race, itís very hard on tyres and we just need to manage that as good as we can and hopefully then we can be competitive tomorrow.î HIGHLIGHTS: Watch the qualifying action from Spa as Verstappen goes fastest while Leclerc inherits pole The result comes after a tough weekend for Verstappen last time out in Hungary and, pushed on whether he can still bounce back from that this time around given his grid slot, the 26-year-old said: ìWe are not making it easy on ourselves and especially, of course, on the battle weíre in I know that today was a great day. ìBut itís in the wet and we need to be quick in the dry tomorrow. Itís going to be a tough battle. Weíll try to do the best we can and hopefully we can battle the Ferraris and Mercedes ahead, and if we have a bit of luck maybe we can challenge the McLarens.î Verstappenís penalty means that Perez will now start from the front row, with his third place in qualifying becoming second on the grid. It marked a better Saturday than the Mexican has experienced of late, yet he acknowledged that the damp weather had still made the session challenging. Perez will start from the front row for the first time since China ìIt was very tricky at times,î Perez reflected. ìObviously, in these conditions itís so easy for it to go wrong ñ as it has been going in the last few qualifyings in these conditions. It was good to finally put it together. ìUnfortunately we didnít have any new tyres for Q3, we were a bit out of sync in Q2 so we were also quite lucky to make it in P10. I think P2 is probably the best position you can wish for in Spa. It was the same with Charles last year, so Iím going to try tomorrow for it to be the same. Itís a long race ahead of us, it looks like itís going to be dry, so weíll see.î FACTS AND STATS: Perez bags first front row start since China after scraping into Q3 by 0.003s While there has been pressure on Perez of late given his difficult run of weekends, the 34-year-old said that he has continued to remain optimistic about turning things around. ìLike Iíve always said, every weekend itís a new opportunity to do better every day,î he added. ìTomorrow is a new opportunity for us to do even better than today and go for that win.î In terms of what he can do on Sunday and if he could be in the fight for victory, Perez responded: ìWeíll see. Itís a very long race ahead of us. I think tomorrow degradation will be quite tricky ñ graining with this new tarmac.
